    <Title>installing apps does not always add menu items</Title>
    <Owner>tariq</Owner>
    <Body> i'm anew user ... i unmasked the  quot;universe quot; repositories to install scribus and lyx (amongst other things).  scribus did appear in the new menu ... but lyx didn't. some other itens such as games didn't.  is there a good way to ensure that installed apps from ubuntu packages do appear for all users? myself i don't mind launching them from the command line but the intended users will not know this and are not command line users.   i did explore /etc/menu and /lib/menus (memory might not be correct here) ... but it didn't work.  i've previously given them mandrake - becuase even if the menus were cluttered and the desktop not so clean - at least everying was available to them from the menu! </Body>

There should be a header or information listed about the person who packaged the app in the description. You could send an email to that person to request they add the menu. </Owner>

      <Owner> thanks to the last poster - that was veyr useful advice (i'm not a gnome / nautilus person myself .. i use xfec and the command line!)  just to check:  * i will install packages one by one * for each installed package i will check that it appears in the menu * if it does not i shall do as the above poster suggested  however - do i need to log out and back in to be sure the installed app did not add a menu item. i say this as there may be a  quot;refresh menus quot; which some install scripts may/may not call.  am i right? is therea refresh-menus command i can do myself without having to logout and back in again between application installs.  forgibe my lack of gnome knowledge!  thanks </Owner>

      <Owner> You know, that this has been an interesting discussion, but it still misses the point that application packagers should be adding the menu support in their packages. If they did that, then there wouldn't be a need to go back and manually do all of this. Some of them do, but unfortunately, many do not (and won't until people harp on it). </Owner>

      <Owner> Debian has probably the most advanced menu support in linux distributions.  Ubuntu does not use it.  Ubuntu uses gnome menus.  If you install a kde desktop on debian, you get a kde menu system with a debian entry which is redundant because it lists all of the installed packages, not just the kde ones. The same goes for gnome. Ubuntu does not seem to use the debian menus.  All debian packages add entries to the debian menu.  I guess it makes for really neat menus, but loses some compatibility with the packages from Universe.... </Owner>

      <Owner> actually, now that you mention it, i think it does only crash after exiting if i have tested the presentation.. If i just open the document and edit it without test viewing it, it closes normally.. Is this a bug with this version of open office, or in ubuntu itself?  thanks, -myk </Owner>

      <Owner> This is a bug in the Ubuntu version of OpenOffice. It has been filed as a bug report, confirmed and marked as critical. No one has a fix for it yet. However, if you install the official OpenOffice from openoffice.org, everything works as expected with no bug.  The install is a bit involved, due to the large number of files to download and install, but there are easy-to-follow instructions that I can post if you're interested in taking that route. </Owner>

      <Owner> Okay, folks, here is the answer I got on the OpenOffice Impress forum (don't know if you have to create a free account to read it or not). A couple of things to note first: You need Alien to convert the RPMS. It's easy to get (info in the link). There is a desktop integration mentioned for GNOME, but the files you download include desktop integration for KDE as well. You'll just have to check the names of the files in the integration folder and change the text in the command line shown in the link.  Other than that, I was impressed by the extra speed and stability of the  quot;factory quot; version of OpenOffice versus the version provided with Ubuntu.  http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?p=194370#194370 </Owner>

The document is still intact so there is no damage. It is a minor nuisance. The fonts with Feisty installed OO2.2 look WAAAYYYY better than the fonts with the downloaded OO2.2.

      <Owner> This is probably a different problem, but I'll throw it in here in case someone searches for it...  I installed Kubuntu Feisty from scratch on 3 different machines, one with the LiveCD and two with the Alternate. On all machines, when I tried to open my OO 2.0.4 spreadsheets, OO calc crashed.  I finally narrowed it down to something this simple: open a brand new spreadsheet, add a button control, add an event 'when mouse button released' to link it to a macro (Sub Main will do). Try to exit design mode - crash.  After trying a number of complicated things, I happened to uninstall all of OO and reinstall it from the repos (in Adept). Problem solved on all three machines.  So I know it sounds Windows-like, but if you're getting OO crashes I suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the whole OO set. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user had an issue with open office crashing on exit. The user observed that the app worked fine but when it got close, the app crashed, the crash recovery thing came up and then opened a blank document.  The other user also experienced the same problem. The user also experienced impress crashing i.e. the presentation only crashed after it was being tested. The problem was due to the bug in the ubuntu version of Open office. The bug report was filed, confirmed and marked as critical. No fix had been found for this problem. The solution of the problem was to install the official openoffice from openoffic.org. The install was a bit involved, due to the large number of files to download and install, but there were easy-to-follow instructions. The instructions were: Go to the OpenOffice Impress forum where the user needs to create a free account to read it. A user needs Alien to convert the RPMS. It's easy to get as the information is available in the link. There is a desktop integration mentioned for GNOME, but the files user download include desktop integration for KDE as well. The user just has to check the names of the files in the integration folder and change the text in the command line shown in the link. The other user also experienced the similar problem. The other problem was the fonts with feisty installed OO2.2 looked way better than the fonts with the downloaded OO2.2 The solution for the font&#8217;s problem was available on this link.http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewto...=194370#194370 The other user experienced one more problem. The user installed Kubuntu Feisty from scratch on 3 different machines, one with the LiveCD and two with the Alternate. On all machines, when a user tried to open my OO 2.0.4 spreadsheets, OO calc crashed. The user finally narrowed it down to something this simple: open a brand new spreadsheet, add a button control, add an event 'when mouse button released' to link it to a macro/ Try to exit design mode - crash. After trying a number of complicated things, the user uninstalled all of OO and reinstall it from the repos (in Adept). Problem solved on all three machines.  The other user reported that the reinstallation/uninstallation doe not fixed with the crash problem. The bug behind the crash problem was sudo aptitude reinstall openoffice.org-base-core openoffice.org-calc openoffice.org-common openoffice.org-core openoffice.org-draw openoffice.org-hyphenation openoffice.org-impress openoffice.org-kde openoffice.org-style-crystal openoffice.org-style-human openoffice.org-thesaurus-en-au openoffice.org-thesaurus-en-us openoffice.org-writer - does not decide a problem ((((((((((</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to crashing of Open Office Impress on exiting on only after have tested the presentation. As this is bug in Ubuntu version of OpenOffice and is confirmed and marked as critical. This can be sometimes resolved as following: One need Alien to convert the RPMS. It's easy to get (info in the link). There is a desktop integration mentioned for GNOME, but the files download include desktop integration for KDE as well. But just have to check the names of the files in the integration folder and change the text in the command line shown in the link.  http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?p=194370#194370. This exit crash problem perhaps needs to be fixed with an update by Canonical. Nevertheless, One can always install the official OpenOffice from openoffice.org, everything will work with no bug or [Ubuntu] Installing OOo on Debian and Co.</Summary_2>

    <Title>Changing mount point with ntfs-3g</Title>
    <Owner>GMaq</Owner>
    <Body> Hello, I am dual-booting XP and Feisty, and have a partition for Feisty (ext2) a partition for XP (ntfs) and a common work partition for both Os's(ntfs). Everything is working wonderfully except that I set the mount point as /media/Work Drive/ and many applications and anything in the terminal don't like the  quot;white space quot; between  quot;Work quot; and  quot;Drive quot; so I want to change the name in the mount point. I am using the NTFS Configuration Tool and it utilizesthe drives perfectly but doesn't allow me to change the mount point. I am still a beginner with terminal command lines, so any guidance would be appreciated. </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> If you mount it through /etc/fstab, you can just edit it   Code: and replace it with the new mount point. Then, save it and create the new mount point so it can mount to it, assuming the new mount point is called /media/Drive.   Code: Then, reboot. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>Changing mount point with ntfs-3g The user is trying to change the mount point in the dual-booting Feisty (ext2) and XP (ntfs) system but unable to change it. Mount code can be changed by editing or by replacing it with the new mount point which is saved by assuming the new mount point called as media/Drive and then reboot the system. The user is also trying to delete the media folder from the work drive and is unable to delete via the file manager. The user wants to know the command to remove the obsolete folder from the terminal. The folder can be removed by the code which is typed after typing the password.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to the change of the mount point because of the "white space" between "work" and "drive" in the terminal command line.

    <Title>Mounting new CD/DVD RW</Title>
    <Owner>malre1</Owner>
    <Body> I have just replaced my CD ROM with a CD/DVD RW machine and although the system does see it their it is not mounted. Could someone please give me or point me to where I can get clear instruction on how to mount. In the partitions settings it sez  Device /dev/scd0 Mount point /media/cdrom0 FS type udf,iso9660 Mount options user,noauto,exec  I would like it to be auto mounted.  Thanks and regards </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> I believe you don't mount the driver itself, rather you mount any cd/dvd you put into the drive. Once you put the disc in go to the terminal and use the command  mount -t type dev dir  where   type is the type of file system, e.g iso9660 or ntfs, it will usually say the type  dev is the dev/sdc0 part you were talking about  dir is the point you want to access the files from, e.g /mnt/mycd  Once you've done that if you go to /mnt/mycd you should see your files.  Don't know if this is want you wanted, but hope it helped anyway.  to unmount use the command  umount dev  regards </Owner>

      <Owner> /mnt/mycd was just a suggestion, if you haven't made the folder then it won't exist. I think cd's and dvd's are mounted automatically in ubuntu, I was just telling you the mount stuff for general purposes, e.g. external hard drive. Have you looked around in your /media folder when you have a cd/dvd in the drive? I think mine usually goes to /media/cdrom or /media/cdrom0. let me know how it goes. </Owner>

    <Summary_2>The discussion is in regard to auto mounting of CD/DVD RW when put it in system Kubuntu 7.10.

It is yet to be resolved.</Summary_2>

    <Body> Examine this for a moment:  Code: Can someone explain what it claims to be doing?  Cos at a first look, it seems to be exploiting a security hole to ask the user for a password.  If that is the case, couldn't someone just as easily create a piece of malware that consistently asks for a users password this way? And if the user is dumb enough to enter his password, (granted that he is a sudo user) potentially infect his whole system?  Just wondering out of curiosity... And concern.  Regards Iain </Body>

      <Owner> Hello, cmay.  Which version of Ubuntu are you using?  I also have very low vision, and I use the eZoom plugin which is in Compiz Fusion, and I turn on a feature for mouse-pointer scaling which makes the mouse pointer increase in size if you zoom the desktop. It si extremely helpful.  if you have Ubuntu 7.10 installed on your system, you can install CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) to make setup a bit easier for you.  Please let me know what version of Ubuntu you are using, and maybe I can help you to get all set up.  If you have ever used programs such as ZoomText or Magic on Windows, (in my opinion) Compiz Fusion's eZoom plugin blows those programs way out of the water. It makes my life a WHOLE LOT esier. This was the thing I was waiting for to completely switch to Ubuntu, and when it arrived in v7.10, I jumped off of the Windows canoe and finally got myself a yacht.   Anyhow, take care, and please write back and et me know if I can be fo any help to you. </Owner>

      <Owner> Hi, Cmay, I not got an answer to you qsn regards a program for ppl with bad vision - in that regards, I personally use a mac, and it's easy to enlarge anything there, but I can, however, give you and any1 else reading this a few tips on how to make sure our eyesight doesnt worsen. You can also restore your eyesight. When you work with a pc, read a book, or when you are doing anything else that requires you to stare at it for a long time, especially close up, you need look around the room, look into the distance now and again. If you do that, your eyesight will NOT get worse. Otherwise, it WILL - it's only normal, only common sense. If you do start noticing your eyesight worsening, then you can start doing more exercises - move your eyes up, down, left, right, look onto your nose etc - do this for a couple of mins once every hour or so, then close your eyes and relax. If you put your hands over your face, so that your eyes are right in the middle of your palms, with no light getting through, and stay like this for a minimum of 3 mins, then your eyes will relax and you'll see a huge improvement. It'll help a lot. If you do this, the n you'll never need to were glasses, no matter what age you are, or what work you do. Hope some1 will read this  amp; it helps - I know, I've been there.

      <Owner>  Quote: Hi,  I just moved to Ubuntu and don't rely on zoom things as much but there was a time when I could not live without ZoomText being on. So for future ref, how do you install compiz fusion and eZoom? I've heard so much about the former but cannot find a d/l link and if you say ezoom is better than ZT I am anxious to see its potential. don't think I'll use it since linux finally lets me tweak the computer and things so i can see it but for reference y'know.  </Owner>

      <Owner> If you set the font size in Firefox, make sure to use the Advanced options and set the minimum font size, and disable the option to let pages choose their own fonts. I have my default font size in firefox at 16pt and the minimum at 13. Many pages will look crappy because they aren't written to expand to acommodate user-chosen font sizes. If you use a site like that a lot you should contact them and let them know they are ignoring important accessibility guidelines that may even be legal obligations in their country, as well as alienating possible customers.  Don't forget you can zoom text in Firefox using the Ctrl-+ and Ctrl-- hotkeys or Ctrl-mousewheel, Ctrl-0 to reset. Firefox 3 remembers the zoom level on a per-site basis so you don't need the nosquint addon anymore. To stop images zooming with the text you need to enter about:config in the address bar, type  quot;browser-zoom-full quot; in the filter field and double-click it set it to false. You can also change the  quot;zoom.maxpercent quot; and  quot;zoom.minpercent quot; settings here.  For magnification I use Compiz with the Enhanced Zoom Desktop and Place Windows plugins. I don't use the Magnifier plug in. To get a window double-size and filling the screen I use this combo, although I may have changed the key bindings from the defaults (Super means the  quot;Windows quot; key quot;):  Super-Keypad-5 - centres the current window (Place Windows plugin) Super-2 - doubles the screen magnification (Zoom plugin) Super-v - resizes the window to the current screen size, i.e. x2 (Zoom plugin). It won't be centred any more though, so... Super-Keypad-5 to centre it again or...  Super-Keypad-N - move the window to N position on the screen, e.g. 7 is top-left, 3 is bottom-right and... Super-r - move and rezoom to fit the current window.  In general, Super-v resizes the window to the zoom level, and Super-r will move and resize the zoomed desktop to the current window. Alt-tabbing between windows will also move the zoomed desktop between them but not resize to fit them. Don't forget Super with the mouse wheel will zoom the desktop to arbitrary values.  You can also constrain the mouse to the zoomed area and scale the mouse with the window, so It's like every application has its own double size desktop. Personally I hate it when the screen moves around as I move the mouse, although you can leave the mouse unconstrained and use the mouse panning option so the screen only moves when you hit the edge, lessening the feeling of  quot;motion sickness quot;  This approach saves you messing around with font sizes in lots of different places - I would say it's impossible to get all applications set up the way you want them, too many ignore the system font settings.  Using this method I can have all windows at double size and switch between them using alt-tab or any of the application switching plugins for Compiz. To reset to 100% zoom simply hit Super-1. You can in fact customise the hotkey zoom levels too, so I have them at 100%, 75%, and 50%. 75% is good for firefox otherwise the toolbars take up too much room and many pages just won't fit in the space. The downside is I can only see the panels when I zoom out to 100%, so I miss flashing icons in the notification area.  So you don't have to use the above combo on every window you open, the Window Rules plugin lets you set the size and position of any windows you open, so you could set it up so all windows are automatically 1/2 the width and height of your display, and position them in the centre, although you'd have to do some math since it takes the top left corner as the position. This has much the same effect as setting your screen resolution to half, except your panels won't be visible so you'd have a little more screen space. There is a problem in that you can't stop the Place Windows plugin from doing smart placement (where it places new windows as far as possible from existing ones - I shall report this as a bug), and this may mess with setting up fixed window placements in the Window Rules plugin.  On the important subject of eyestrain and other computer related disorders, there is a program in the Ubuntu repos called Workrave, I highly recommend it. It is a timer that nags you to take microbreaks, rest breaks, and limit your daily computer usage. It is much smarter than other similar programs that will nag you even if you have just returned from a break. If you are bad for skipping breaks you can even set it to lock the screen, although it will let you skip or postpone a break if you absolutely must.  I take a 20 second microbreak every 5 minutes where I stand up and look out the window at the farthest thing I can see. Every 45 minutes I take a 5 minute break where I walk around and relax my upper body, or do some household chores (I work from home). My eyes no longer water, my eyelids no longer twitch, my wrist and lower back pain are gone, and I seem to get my work done faster as a result. I know computers can enhance the lives of people who are differently abled in various ways, but you must take steps to ensure they don't negatively affect your health in the long term.  Hope this helps you some, I shall watch this thread so if you need any further clarification feel free to ask, it is a lot to take in all at once. Compiz has many accessibility features but that can make it difficult to find the ones you need and configure them however suits you best.   Code:  Quote:  </Owner>

      <Owner> I am using compiz with the ezoom plugin in 8.04 it comes pre installed not necessarily pre-configured   What i find useful:  Super/Windows Key + Scroll up on mouse :   This does not limit you to 3 zoon levels and allows you to modify the zoom level at will.  If you have a five button mouse you can set the Super / Windows key + back button to reset view.  Super/Windows Key + m: Inverts everything bar the desktop  Super/Windows Key + n: Inverts the current window useful for firefox when you have a page with black background.  Just as a side note getting this all to work is a little easier said than done. I have an ATI HD card connected through HDMI to a 32 inch TV screen. This was not straight forward.   Some hardware can be very troublesome and others not compiz sometime just works out of the box straight after install the best way to check is Super/Windows Key + m if everything goes inverted your in business. Otherwise you may need to start by installing proprietary driver support and or the GLX package for your graphics card.  ** GLX WARNING : This may break your graphics output on reeboot. Be sure you are aware and can see enough to do a xorg reset in recovery mode.  If the GLX goes in okay if you may need to enable it by going System - gt; Preferences - gt; Appearance. Then navigate to the last tab Visual Effects and change the button to normal. If it works then it will ask you to keep the settings otherwise it will complain that it can not start. Back to the drawing board at that point.   It can be worth checking the forums for your graphics card and if it supports compiz and how hard/easy it is to setup.  This is not a full gude but give you ideas of where you need to start looking. In my experience compiz will not work on anything less than 1Ghz machine and thats a push. Not many of those around, just in my room.   Tom </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user wanted to know about the programs which help people who could barely see. The user installed the supertux and restarted the computer. The user observed the change in the font sizes. The font size was previously at 23 but after the restart it was observed incredibly small. The user has registered himself/herself on the forum to get help but because of the wrong password, the user was unable to login on the forum website.  The other option was to keep Compiz fusion enabled so the user can use the zoom magnifier plugins. One of the users moved the thread to Assistive Technology and Accessibility Discussions to get better help. There was an extension for fixefox known as no squint which can be helpful. More information can be found at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2592. One of the users, who had very low vision, used the eZoom plugin which was in the Compiz Fusion. The user turned on a feature for mouse-pointer scaling which made the mouse pointer increase in size when zoom the desktop. The Compix Config Settings Manager CCSM can be installed on Ubuntu 7.10. The user felt Compiz Fusion's ezoom plugin was better than ZoomText or Magic. In firefox the user can increase the font size from view&gt;Text Size then click increase. A quicker way to increase is to press ctrl and move scroll up or down to down to zoom in or out. Low resolution will give the large screen size which would have huge letters, images, etc The user was suggested as follows if he/she set the font size in Firefox, make sure to use the Advanced options and set the minimum font size, and disable the option to let pages choose their own fonts. I have my default font size in firefox at 16pt and the minimum at 13. Many pages will look crappy because they aren't written to expand to acommodate user-chosen font sizes.

The good source that can help is searching the thread  "Assistive Technology and Accessibility Discussions".The user is advised from another similar characteristic person  who has very low vision,who uses the eZoom plugin which is in Compiz Fusion, and to turn on a feature for mouse-pointer scaling which makes the mouse pointer increase in size by zoom the desktop. This feature is best when Ubuntu 7.10 installed on your system, also can install CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) to make setup easier.

      <Owner> I also have an HP DeskJet 5850 network printer -- it worked fine in Debian Sarge, but I have not been able to get it working properly in Ubuntu Breezy. The configuration details are simple: HP JetDirect (actually IPP), static IP number of the printer, and port 9100; using the HP-DeskJet_5850-hpijs.ppd driver.   In my case, the Ubuntu test page was shifted 2.5cm (1in) upwards, clipping the top of the page. And printing a PDF-file straight to the printer with  quot;lp file.pdf quot; puts the printer all of a sudden in double-sided mode -- even though I have it configured as single-sided.  I believe the problem is in the  quot;gnome-cups-manager quot; package that is used via the Administration/Printing menu. May be it detects that the double-sided attachment is installed on the printer, and assumes that it then also should be used... In Debian Sarge I did the identical configuration via the http://localhost:631 interface, but this route is disabled in Ubuntu. I have filed a bug about this -- #17820, so I am waiting for a solution on this. </Owner>

      <Owner> Thanks for the suggestion -- of course you meant editing /etc/cups/cupsd.conf... Sure, this gave me access to http://localhost:631, I found the printer properly configured (except  quot;A4 quot; size had somehow reverted back to default  quot;Letter quot; size), and the standard CUPS test page printed correctly in single-sided mode.  But still, my little PDF test file, produced with pdfLaTeX, prints double-sided when printed with  quot;lp test.pdf quot;, yet single-sided when printed from within Evince. Curious... </Owner>

    <Title>XMMS alternatives</Title>

    <Body> After going to some issues, I got XMMS working on Ubuntu. Now, I've been using XMMS for years now, and I've always loved it, but lately I've been under the impression that development kinda stopped (or is very, very slow).  So I'm looking at alternatives for it, but none that really suit my need. Ideally, I would like XMMS with GTK2 support and the ability to load newer winamp skins.  I looked at Beep (XMMS fork to GTK2), but it does did not work very well for me. I wanted to try Rhythmbox, but it wanted to search through my music directories (which takes forever so I killed it).  Are there any others that I'm not aware of? I'm not looking for something with indexing capabilities like Rhythmbox. </Body>

      <Owner> You might want to try Muine which is now in Gnome CVS. It's a little dependancy-heavy, but a great app. I haven't used it in a while but, I'm compiling it now and maybe I'll post a .deb if I get around to it.  Edit: Maybe not, the deps are ugly and SourceForge is down for maintenance (as usual) so I can't even grab the gtk# libs. Looks like I'll wait for it in hoary or the backports (wink, wink jdong). </Owner>

      <Owner> Muine rocks, it's probably my favorite.  Rhythmbox might be hanging because you have other files in your music folders. Images, text files, etc, will cause it to hang.  Zinf is pretty nifty as well, but I like Muine and Rythmbox the best because of their lightweightedness (no that's not a word) </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user had experienced a problem with XMMS on Ubuntu. The XMMS got slowed. The user wanted XMMS with GTK1 support and the ability to load newer winamp skins. The user looked at Beep (XMMS fork to GTK2), but it does did not work very well for him/her. The user wanted to try Rhythmbox, but it wanted to search through the music directory which was taking more time. The other user was also unable to run XMMS on Ubuntu. The user tried installing dependencies and XMMS but observed the error message as no acceptable C compiler found at $Path. The user tried installing it from Universe and it worked well. It was suggested to get an extra lib if the user had a nvidia card. Music Player Daemon (with client) can be a good replacement for XMMS. It can be downloaded from http://www.musicpd.org/ A possible alternative for XMMS (with the same kind of GUI) is Beep Media Player http://www.sosdg.org/~larne/w/BMP_Homepage Deb package on this page. http://www.imendio.com/projects/jamboree/  The user found a 'lightweight' indexing mp3 itunes-like prog for Gnome. The user tried loading songs which took 3 hours. The music files were on an NFS server. The other user loaded xmms Hashimoto as the rhythmbox did not load all the songs. http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/xmms2/ I couldn't get it to install tho. can be the other alternative to XMMS. According to the Rhythmbox faq, problem was due a GStreamer bug that doesn't recognize some mp3 types. One of the users wanted to know the name of the extra lib for nvidia card users. The user was suggested to search the name in the thread. Amarok was another alternative to XMMS. It was similar to iTunes. The user was suggested Muine, which was in Gnome CVS. It was a little dependancy-heavy but was a great app. Zinf was pretty nifty as well. One of the users had downloaded the Muine and  needed information about the installation. Following was the information to Muine installation; click the install file from the download files. Follow the instructions mentioned in it. Make sure the system has got all the requirements stated in the README file. One of the users also faced XMMS problem so he/she was suggested to get libmikmod if a user had a nvidia card. AmaroK is used to run KDE programs on a gnome system but its appearance would be ugly unless the user installs the rest of KDE. The other alternative for XMMS was the Beep Media Player. The user can get more skins for it by installing  XMMS-skins from universe by opening /usr/share/xmms/Skins in your file browser, and dragging the *.tgz files into the Preferences -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Skin pane. The other way to run the XMMS is to follow instructions mentioned on the webpage http://blog.sartek.net/2008/04/insta...rdy-heron.html</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This question was in regard to XMMS alternatives working in Ubuntu as it became very slow over years (almost stopped). But the user need XMMS with GTK2 support and the ability to load newer winamp skins. The user tried Beep (XMMS fork to GTK2) and Rhythmbox but did not liked it. The user is not particularly looking for something with indexing capabilities like Rhythmbox.To run XMMS on Ubuntu if error message encounters saying  'no acceptable C compiler found at $Path' just installed it from Universe (or multivers install it from Universe (or multivers), for nvidia card need an extra library  libmikmod If fonts are tiny and  together have to install non-truetype fonts that match the resolution. Rhythmbox might be hanging because you have other files in the user music folders. Images, text files, etc, will cause it to hang. Zinf is pretty nifty, where as Muine and Rythmbox something to do with lightweightedness. Using Zinf, its display is not nice. To install Muine properly, one has to Look at the 'INSTALL' file in download. Opening it with an editor, and will find installation instructions. one has to make  sure all the requirements stated in the 'README' file without them run into problem. To take advantage of mysql needs 2 apps: mp3kult and prokyon3. For a good source to compile and run XMMS can refer to http://blog.sartek.net/2008/04/insta...rdy-heron.html</Summary_2>

    <Title>Default program per file extension ?</Title>
    <Owner>abelthorne</Owner>
    <Body> Hello, Is it possible in Ubuntu to set a default program for a file extension, indepentdently of its content? AFAIK, Linux doesn't use extensions to recognize the type of a file (I guess it uses MIME).  My problem is that Scribus files (.sla) are plain text files (XML I think). So, when I double-click on one, it will open with the text editor. I can right-click on one and select  quot;open with Scribus quot; in the menu, but that's not very user-friendly. If I set the default program for this kind of file to Scribus, I get an error message saying  quot;the filename says that its a Scribus file but the content says plain text quot; and doesn't let me open the file. And BTW, if I add Scribus to the default programs list it will appear twice in the contextual menu and it will appear in the menu of plain text files, which I don't want to.  How do I - if possible - sort this out? </Body>

    <Body> hi.. m not entirely sure where to post this, but since m customising my desktop ll put it here..  i want to change the color of the background of thunar file manager.. or even possibly use an image as a background... does anyone know if this is possible?   i *think* something can be done by editing a gtk config file.., but i wouldnt even know where to start..   can anyone pls advise?  i had a look around google  amp; xfce  amp; thunar websites/wiki.. but the documentation isnt great.. so any relevant linkage is also warmly received.. : s)  thanks. </Body>

      <Owner> Hi! Sorry to revive this thread, but I'm interested in doing this too, and I can't find how. I suppose it can be changed using the .gtkrc-2.0 file, but I can't figure out its widget name. Any ideas? Thanks! </Owner>

    <Title>Saving the changes to Desktop in Gutsy</Title>
    <Owner>Dark Hornet</Owner>
    <Body> Ok...so I did a clean install of Gutsy yesterday, and everything went smooth....I installed my restricted drivers, set my screen resolution, etc, etc. Then I came to modifying my desktop settings, most notably the tool bars at the bottom and top of my desktop. I removed the items that I didn't want, and added some others, so that everything was just how I like it. The issue comes when I either restart X, or reboot the machine--when my desktop comes up after a reboot, the  quot;bottom quot; toolbar is always at the top of the screen right under the top one.....How can I save the settings so that this does not happen.  **EDIT**--I have already tried to go  quot;Sessions quot; and check the save session on reboot option.  Thanks for any help you can provide. </Body>

    <Title>Desktop icon are arranged alphabetical for new users</Title>
    <Owner>jakommo</Owner>
    <Body> Hi all,  we run a internetcafe based on a diskless linux system. till now we used gentoo + kde but I'm working on an new system based on ubuntu + gnome.  it just works fine expect one big problem: for each customer a account is created with a customized Desktop from /etc/skel. because most of the people are not used to linux we need some special icons on the Desktop for firefox, logout and IM's. if I login to a new created account I get the right theme and the panel is like it was on the  quot;default quot; account (the account which I created the skel from) but the icons on the desktop aren't in the place where they where on the default account. They are all on the left side of the desktop and arranged in alphabetical order.  But I need them to be on  quot;fixed quot; position.  With KDE its no problem, they log in and the icons are arranged correctly.  I'm new to GNOME so maybe I just missing an option to do that.  I already tried with  quot;keep aligned quot; checked and unchecked but there is no difference. I've also tried to not use /etc/skel but copy the content from the  quot;default quot; account to the newly created.  is this even possible? does someone know where the alignment of the Desktop icons is stored?  I've made two screenshots from what I want and what I get.  I would be glad if someone could help me.  regards  jakommo </Body>
    <Summary_1>The user wanted to arrange the desktop icons in a different order other than alphabetical order was not able to do it.  With KDE, the user was able to fix the icon positions but in new GNOME, the option of arranging icon was missing. The user tried keep aligned option but was not helpful. Also, the user tried not to use /etc/skel but copied the content from the default. The user wanted to know where the alignment of the Desktop icons was stored.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to Desktop icon arrangement alphabetically in GNOME and user wants it to be fixed like in KDE. This is yet to be resolved.</Summary_2>

    <Title>Firestarter and printing sharing</Title>
    <Owner>CatMihV</Owner>
    <Body> Well, i have the following problem. I have 2 printers, an HP Laserjet 1020 and a photosmart c1300 series. Installed them, shared them, everything works ok until i launch Firestarter. When Firestarter is active the other 2 computers in the network (running winXP) can't acces them. If i turn off Firestarter they work ok but ther's no internet connection sharing. I tryed to enter lots of policies in Firestarter, opened all the ports that i saw they were used in  quot;Events quot; tab and still it doesn't work. I searched for hours on google and on forum and still didn't find a solution. If someone can help me, without unninstaling Firestarter, pls help me.  And on top of that, 1 of the computers doesn't have any trafic with the ubuntu box (that i use as a router and soon some other stuff) and i can't understand why. I removed all policies and it simply won't work, no ping no nothing. The other computer works just fine.  Thnx in advance for your help. </Body>

I installed a webserver (apache2, as instructed here: http://www.lullabot.com/videocast/in...-server-ubuntu ). Now, the 2 pc's in network can ping the server, can access the webpage but there is no net sharing. If i use Firestarter there is net sharing but the printers and the webpage can't be accessed . Should i start learning on how to make my own firewall using iptables? (Tryed kmyfirewall too, but there are some errors at launch that i couldn't find answers for them so i gave up) </Owner>

    <Body> When selecting a mirror for linux download files, is it better to select an http or a ftp server? </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> Each has pros and cons. Pick what works best for you for that mirror. Some FTP servers have resumable downloads, so if the download fails, and the FTP client allows resumption, you can pick up where you left off.  FTP has been around for ages, and was the de-facto standard for file transfer. But its command set is simplistic and rudamentary.  With the advent of the web as most know it today, FTP required users to enter ftp:// vs. http:// which they are more accustomed to. Early on, there was a lot of confusion about file types of downloaded data, and how the browser should deal with the data. As HTTP and browsers matured, downloads via HTTP have become well behaved, but it wasn't always so.  There is additional meta-data that can accompany the transfer in HTTP, and this allows some browser conveniences.  Pick the one that works best in your case, for your client. </Owner>

    <Body> I have a very strange problem. I don't know how or why, but the bottom right of my screen has two sets of four horizontal black bars, and the only way I know of to rid myself of them is to go into a console (alt+ctrl+F1) and come back to my KDE session. They are gone for a while, but seem to come back every-so-often.  What are these black glitches? How do I get rid of them?  I'm using a Dell Inspiron 1501 with an integrated ATI Radeon XPress on it.

Th story goes like this:  I saw this post   http://4front-tech.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7485#7485  and as I have an X-Fi sound card in my machine I decided to give it a try. I installed the deb-package and true enough, alsatest was able to get sounds out of my X-Fi-card. Nothing else worked though, so I decided to go back my old ways, which is using the integrated sound chip of the main board in Ubuntu and the X-Fi-card when playing games in Windows. So I removed oss-linux, but then I realised I have no sound at all. System - gt; Preferences - gt; Sound does not recognize any sound card at all. Alsamixer returns this error   Code: and command    Code: returns an empty list.   Code: gives me this    Code: You can see the nForce2 AC97 sound controller there, but how to get it in use?

    <Title>Failure to boot my Serval!</Title>
    <Owner>Kaloma</Owner>
    <Body> Since yesterday (when I installed the latest Ubuntu 'edgy' kernel security update), my Serval Performance system has failed to boot several times. This problem required a hard shutdown and reboot.  The first time this occurred, I tried booting into recovery mode, which seemed to work around the issue.  The second time, even recovery mode did not work; three times I attempting to boot without success. Since I could see the boot status this time I noticed the message  quot;BUG: soft lockup on CPU#0 quot;. This did not sound very good to me.  Fortunately, I have just booted my system successfully again after flipping the wireless card switch on the chassis to the 'on' position. I had previously turned it 'off' since I was not using it at the time and had noticed an apparent CPU bug whereby one of my cores was always at 100% frequency even when not in use according to the system monitor.  Anyhow, I don't know if the switch was the cause/cure or not, because when the problem first began I still managed to boot with the switch 'off' and so far I have only had one success with it 'on'. (I need to do some important work before I can test this theory and risk not being able to boot again.)  Has anyone else heard of or experienced a similar problem?  -Matthew- </Body>
    <Comment>

      <Owner> I do have the driver version mentioned in that notice. However, neither of the files noted are missing from /usr/lib/xorg/modules. Also, my boot process was failing well before attempting to initialize X. I now reinstalled the nvidia-glx package just in case.  Since flipping the wireless card switch back to the 'on' position, I have not had this problem. I haven't yet tried switching it 'off' again to see if I can reproduce it.  Regarding the issue of one cpu core running at 100% frequency all the time, my best guess now is that it may not be related to the wireless card/driver. I have recently noticed that it the issue seems to be related to coming out of hibernation. If I boot my system fresh, I do not observe the behavior, but if I hibernate and resume then I notice it.  Many thanks to Carl and hackmeister for your help. If you happen to discover any more information about the error message I initially posted, let me know. Otherwise, I have my workaround for now.  -Matthew- </Owner>

    <Title>Spontaneous Grub breakage</Title>
    <Owner>cowbean</Owner>
    <Body> Tonight I powered up my couple-weeks-old Darter, and the Grub message that usually says something like  quot;Grub loading stage 2 quot;, it just said  quot;Grub  quot; with a blinking cursor after it. Ctrl-Alt-Del wouldn't reboot, turning off and back on via the power button resulted in the same screen.  I followed this thread's instructions to reinstall Grub, and now everything seems peachy.  My question is, what might cause spontaneous grub breakage like this? I had shutdown normally last time the computer was operational. Is this an indication that there is a physical defect with the hard drive?  As a precaution I am carrying around the Ubuntu CD in case I need to install grub again. </Body>

      <Owner> The annoying part is that the only posts I can find about this issue only show up as problems with XGL. But I have an NVidia card, so I'm using THAT codepath. I think this happens each time I've installed Gutsy and done a dist-upgrade (since Alpha 1); does nobody else have this issue? No GeForce 8600's in the house? </Owner>

My EXACT commands :  # sudo apt-get update # sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic  Then I went to the restricted drivers manager and installed the Nvidia driver (100.14.11 is the current latest via that method)  # sudo modprobe nvidia # sudo depmod -a  Logged out, logged back in. Desktop effects are working, success! Run - gt; gnome-terminal  # glxgears  Desktop resets back to login screen. WTF is going on here?! Am I seriously the only person dealing with this?!  gt;_ lt; ANGER. Mind you, this is still on the Tribe5 LiveCD. </Owner>

      <Owner> well a cube has 6 sides... do you mean to have a separate cube? or more like a pentahexahedron type of thing? or just to have all 6 sides including top  amp; bottom show a desktop instead of just the 4 sides? </Owner>

    <Title>7.10 Compiz-fusion window size problem</Title>
    <Owner>TubaTodd</Owner>
    <Body> I just installed Ubuntu 7.10 last night and everything went very well. My only problem is that I can't seem to get Compiz fusion to agree on the proper screen width. My laptop has a 1280x800 lcd screen. I have an Acer 22 quot; (1680x1050) widescreen monitor plugged into the laptop full-time (I don't use the laptop LCD at all).   When running off the Live CD and after hard disk installation, I noticed that when desktop effects are enabled (compiz-fusion) that ALL windows open pinned to the upper left hand corner. If I hit maximize, the screen enlarges but only to a 1280x800 sized window. If I drag the window to the center of the screen and maximize it, it stretches to the full with of my 1680x1050 screen. Unfortunately, the second I click anywhere on that window, it resizes back to the 1280x800 resolution again.   So far, my only fix was to disable desktop effects. All windows act properly WITHOUT desktop effects turned on. BTW, when I had Feisty installed (using the very same xorg.conf file and everything) compiz-fusion worked GREAT!!! I just installed compiz-fusion using these instructions.  http://forlong.blogage.de/article/20...-Ubuntu-Feisty  Any ideas on what is causing this?  Oh yeah....my laptop does NOT support dual monitors nor does the new screen amp;graphics application let me configure more than 1 screen for use. </Body>

System - gt; Preference - gt; Advanced Desktop Effects Settings - gt; General Options - gt; Display Settings  4. Uncheck  quot;Detect Outputs quot;  5. Modify  quot;Outputs quot; as  quot;1680x1050+0+0 quot;  6. System - gt; Preference - gt; Appearance - gt; Visual Effects - gt; Custom  7. Reboot.  If it helps you, please let me know.  I have still problem with dual monitor probelm. With the configuration, it does not allow to select secondary display. Anyway, I wish this would help you. </Owner>

      <Owner> I also have this problem with the Gutsy Live CD - I have an Intel 945GM graphics chip hooked up by VGA to an HDTV as my only monitor. I know that my HDTV spews out 1024x768 as the highest supported resolution to the x.org log, but the xserver-xorg-video-intel driver package thingy correctly feeds 1280x768 to my HDTV anyway for proper unstretched fullscreen HDTV goodness. With compiz enabled, when I maximize, all the windows only expand to 1024 pixels wide.  My point with all the above is to ask if compiz takes settings from the x.org log? If so that is silly, and could the resolution data be taken from ubuntu's screen resolution dialog config file as that gives the correct resolution of 1280x768? Should I stick this data into a bug report?  I will try this solution once I have installed gutsy to my hard drive, hoping it works for me too.  Phil </Owner>

Emerald- I have the emerald theme manager but when I try to apply a theme nothing happens...I double click, and nothing happens. I tried downloading a new theme and the same thing happend. I imported it, and double clicked. (nothing happend, lol.)  AWN- I cant seem to get firefox or any other applett/launcher to work with AWN besides the ones that came with it. I drag and drop on the bar, on the awn manager screen, anywhere....and nothing happens, lol.  Thanks for the help, hopefully I can get this to fully work, lol. </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> The theme manager doesn't load emerald when started, you have to run 'emerald --replace' to have it replace your current running window decorator. Just make a shortcut/launcher, or add it to Sessions if you want it started upon logging in.  Can't help you with AWN though. </Owner>

    <Summary_2>The discussion is in regard to AWN and Emerald theme managers to apply the new osx theme and not working. This can be resolved as following: As the theme manager doesn't load emerald when started, and have to run 'emerald --replace' to have it replace the current running window decorator. Just make a shortcut/launcher, or add it to Sessions to start upon logging in and an ampersand (&amp;) after any command to make it run in the background but this makes the window borders go away. To work perfectly the user should restart the system. For AWN related it is resolved yet. And for gtk Mac themes there is Mac4Lin's amazing Leopard Transformation Pack and for anything "Mac" related there is a seperate discussion thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=555373</Summary_2>

    <Title>Compiz-Fusion binding problem</Title>
    <Owner>AdHavoc</Owner>
    <Body> I recently installed Compiz-Fusion (the CCCM) in Ubuntu 7.10 and everything works great, but I have a question. For some reason, every time I use the right click button, it activates some effect where all of the virtual desktops are spread out on a single line. I cannot find the setting for this, so I am unable to right click on anything, which is quite annoying. Also, is there some way to zoom out farther in the Desktop Cube setting when rotating the cube?  Thanks. </Body>

      <Owner> While we wait for more information, if you ever want to start something in a terminal and you don't want it to terminate upon closing the terminal itself, just add an ampersand ( amp; sign) after the command to make it run in the background.   Code: You can then terminate the process either by invoking kill and supplying the PID number that was output upon running the command itself (right after gedit there in that example), or by calling killall gedit (or whatever the name was of the command you ran). Do note that if you have several processes with the same name, all with get terminated. Hence, killall. </Owner>

    <Title>Partition Rodeo Question</Title>
    <Owner>oldtug</Owner>
    <Body> First off, finally took the leap and installed 9.04 in my badly bloated Dell Insperon 600m in its own partition of about 9.5MB. Things seem to be running fine on the Ubuntu side. (A bit like stepping off the boat onto an new undiscovered land)   I now want to wipe the XP partition and do a clean XP install, and at same time divide the total HD capacity between the 2 systems.  What is the best practice to follow? I don't want to (if I don't have to) reinstall 9.04.   If I use the XP install disk will that wipe ALL partitions on disk, including 9.04, or just the XP side of things? Or is there a method that works using the live 9.04 disk.  Thanks  Eric in Seattle  PS: I'm starting to enjoy the feeling of removing myself from the M*M*I*C! (microsoft mac industrial complex) </Body>

    <Title>3 LARGE errors in Ubuntu 8.10- Shutdown, Screen Flicker, Random Desktops Flashing</Title>
    <Owner>BastardNamban</Owner>
    <Body> I am posting this for a friend, who needs some help. He doesn't have an account here yet.  3 Major problems with his 8.10 Intrepid install-   1. His desktop is randomly changing every so many seconds, not regularly, between 2 backgrounds. The main one stays up, and flashes to the same other one for a couple seconds, then returns. I can't figure out why.  2. Most annoying- computer refuses to shut down! Going to shutdown supposedly shuts down the computer, no activity, but bumping the mouse restarts it. He can't shut it down without hitting the physical switch. I am not hitting hibernate by accident- this is for real.  3. Gave him Gstreamer XINE to watch DVDs finally, and it worked, but the same problem he had before keeps occuring- the media player output now reads the DVD, plays and all, but it keeps flickering to black fast, making the movie unwatchable, even though you can tell it is playing fine otherwise.  Ideas? We're headed out to dinner now, I'll check back in a few hours. </Body>

      <Owner> Forgive me, I try NOT to be a help vampire. But I myself am not extremely knowledgeable on ubuntu, as I'm self taught myself.   Quote:  well, this is going to sound snarky any way I say it after posting that, but I'm sorry, can you give precise  amp; detailed account of what exactly  quot;live run mode quot; is, and what the memtest function is?  Before you shoot back at me, I admit to not knowing a lot. I can google these things endlessly, and get it maybe, or someone like you who seems to know could have explained it simply and what to do/how to access it for me, and helped teach me, to get a quicker answer, spared me endless googling for one helpful page. I still don't know what  quot;live-run mode quot; is or what that has to do with all this. I'm sorry.  Specs: I was specific with Ubuntu (gnome interface 2.24.1) 8.10, Intrepid, kernel 2.6.27-14. This is the sole OS installed, no windows, no dual boot. My friend supposedly had a guru put all this on for him that I've never met, and from what I can tell, he put a lot of stuff on that my friend neither uses or knows of. And the movie thing flashing to black happened after the guru last touched this, he says. I'm thinking the supposed guru knows even less about what he's doing than I do, and I don't know much myself.  He has AWN installed as well as compiz settings manager (2 things that often seem to give issues to other people's computers, I noticed, which is why I mention them), and I've already tried running through the shutdown preferences and workarounds tab in compiz to see if I could find an things that might be causing these. I turned off legacy screen support in workarounds, still nothing.  The mouse that upon moving wakes up the shutdown computer is a Toshiba 3 button mouse, red light. From what I can tell, he's running a custom rig of some sort that looks old. I'm not even sure if he knows what he has. He left it all to his guru I never met.  Lastly, I looked for a hardware list and did this  Code: .  Here's what I got (could it be a graphics card issue?)  Code: And yes I realize that's cut off- I don't know how to get the top part, the terminal erases it before I can see it since the thing is all so long. Sorry.  I know this is probably not enough to diagnose, but I don't know where to start or what else you need to know. Honestly, I'm thinking of wiping his computer and just reinstalling 8.04 and building it for him personally, as I understand that, I feel.  Does anything here help? </Owner>

      <Owner> A for effort!  The Ubuntu disk should be a live-run CD AND it will also have memtest on it as well as the installer.  Put the disk in the machine and have the machine boot from the disk  you should see a screen with some different selections  one of the selections will be to  quot;try ubuntu without changing anything quot;  that is your live-run so please select  quot;try ubuntu quot; and allow the system to load  now experiment to see how a  quot;straight ubuntu install quot; would work </Owner>

I don't have time now to try any of this- today. I'll have to come back sometime next week or something.  It looks like this could be an issue with his graphics card then?  I don't have a live disk here, he doesn't either. I'll have to burn one when I get home. He's using Intrepid, but would this issue be fixed on a newer release if I installed one (ie: Jaunty)? </Owner>

ATI's driver has the flickering problem when you have desktop effects AND you play video or use an OpenGL program at the same time.

Honestly, we can apologize for people who code anyday, saying it's hard, the problem was just found, etc., but if this has been a known problem for some time and they don't care to fix it, that's atrocious. I see why Nvidia is so prevalent now under linux. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user faced 3 major problems with his 8.10 intrepid install. 1 The desktop kept randomly changing at every so many seconds but not regularly between 2 backgrounds. 2 The computer refuses to shut down. Shut down supposedly shuts down the computer, no activity but bumping the mouse restarts it. The user was not hitting the hibernate. 3 Gstreamer Xine was used to watch DVD which worked initially but the media player output now reads the DVD plays and all but it kept flickering to black fast, making the movie unwatchable. The problem can be tested my operating system in the live-run mode. The result of the memtest function of memory of the live run should be helpful. The Ubuntu disk should be a live-run CD AND it would also have memtest on it as well as the installer. Put the disk in the machine and have the machine boot from the disk you should see a screen with some different selections one of the selections will be to "try ubuntu without changing anything" that is a live-run so please select "try ubuntu" and allow the system to load now experiment to see how a "straight ubuntu install" would work. The problem can be due to the graphics card. The other solution was to uninstall wallpaper-tray from the synaptic.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to 3 errors with 8.10 Intrepid install in Ubuntu 8.10. The 3 problems are as follows: 1. User is experiencing screen flickering randomly. 2. The system is refusing to shut down without hitting the physical switch and 3. Gstearmer Xine media player output reads the DVD and keeps flickering and making the video unwatchable. This can be resolved if the the user run Ubuntu disk should be a live-run CD and getting a 9.04 disk from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=611492 correct the issues. ATI's driver has the flickering problem when the desktop effects and play video or use an OpenGL program at the same time. Perhaps, this can be a graphics card issue that can be resolved using Nvidia card rather than ATI.</Summary_2>

    <Title>[SOLVED] The old guitar learning sofware question!</Title>
    <Owner>Dutch70</Owner>
    <Body> I see this question has been ask a hundred times, but I can't find an answer that suits me.   I have been playing for about a year, so I know how to read tabliture...ha! just dont know how to spell it! lol, anyway, I want something that is open source. Not so much because it is free,(I'm sure there are good programs cheap) but thats not the point, it's because of the spirit of open source. I hope to one day get rid of all non-free crap on my PC.  anybody, any and all answers are welcome and appreciated, just looking for opinions here.  Dutch </Body>

      <Owner> oh darn it, just got a good look at it, and I would bet that it is awesome for a real musician, but I just want something simple, I will check it out more, but just lookin at it, seems more complex than the guitar itself. On the other hand, my nephew is an awesome up and coming musician, and I am sure he will love it. can't wait to show him. he's been playin about 15 years, written some songs that I really like. </Owner>

      <Owner> i say stick with tux guitar - its helping me learn (though i know it looks complex). get some power tabs from here http://www.guitarprotabs.org/, double click them and they'll open in tux. if they dont, right click them and select 'open with'.   the lines in tux represent the guitar strings, and the numbers what fret to put your finger on.   you can even press the play button and have tux play the song to you!  im just learning to play too, and i say tuxguitar is worth investing time in.   see also this website  http://www.justinguitar.com/  no software, but some youtube based video lessons.   good luck! </Owner>

      <Owner> Torrent some guitar instructional videos by Paul Gilbert. I learned a lot from those . Or you could just search them on YouTube. There are a lot of amateur instructional videos out there which could also be song specific.  Also, stick to Tuxguitar as it is good software released under GPL. Just look for .gp# files for the particular songs that you like. I sometimes print out the tabs so I wouldn't have to open my machine everytime I want to study them. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user wanted to know the guitar learning software which has open source. Tuxguitar was available software to read powertabs and guitar pro tabs. It can be downloaded from the tuxguitar website. It was also available in Synaptic from where it can be sudo. Some other different guitar programs can be downloaded to sourceforge.net. The user also needed information about the websites which teach to play a song, chords and tab without making too much to read. Tux guitar software seemed to be good learning software for learning guitar as the some power tabs downloaded from guitarprotabs can be openend in Tux guitar. Tux guitar can play music. There are some websites like justinguitar.com which has video lessons. The user needed a song called more than a memory to work on tuxguitar. Guitar chords galore,http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/top/top100.htm and http://www.chordie.com/ can be used to download the songs. Advanced search can also be useful. Torrent has some guitar instructional videos by Paul Gilbert. Youtube has lot of amateur instructional videos which could be also song specific.</Summary_1>

PAE support 64G, CPU customization ....).  Thanks. </Body>

    <Comment>
      <Owner> boot windows into safe mode so it uses the generic drivers for your keyboard and mouse rather than any fancy ones you may have.  Lets be honest, this isn't really anything to do with ubuntu.  You should also have either the packet/sticky label with your product code on if it's genuine. </Owner>

It is to do with ubuntu though because i'm using it for data recovery. Safe mode isn't an option most likely due to conflicting drivers or a registry corruption (This is my friends machine). Ive run  lt;code gt;chkdsk /r lt;/code gt; in recovery console (Windows)and still no joy so now i'm looking to ubuntu for solutions. </Owner>

      <Owner> If that doesnt work have a look at the following post:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=955950  You can edit the windows registry by downloading the MiTEc file onto your ubuntu partition:-  http://www.soft411.com/company/MiTeC...ile-Viewer.htm  Once downloaded mount your windows partition as read-write (or read only if you dont want to make any changes, then run the MiTec program with wine. You need to point it to the mount point, and then to the windows registry: e.g. /media/sda1/WINDOWS/system32/config/software  The software hive will have your prodct key open Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion and then use google to convert it from ProductID to ProductKey  Edit: Just tried this and it looks as though you cannot delete or edit any registry keys or folders. I have write permission but there appears to be no way to make any changes. </Owner>

The other user had suggested to follow the steps given on the following post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=955950 The user can edit the windows registry by downloading the MiTEc file onto an ubuntu partition:- http://www.soft411.com/company/MiTeC...ile-Viewer.htm Once downloaded mount a windows partition as read-write (or read only if a user dont want to make any changes, then run the MiTec program with wine. The user need to point it to the mount point, and then to the windows registry: e.g. /media/sda1/WINDOWS/system32/config/software The software hive will have your prodct key open Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion and then use google to convert it from ProductID to ProductKey Edit: Just tried this and it looks as though user cannot delete or edit any registry keys or folders.  The user has write permission but there appears to be no way to make any changes. The other way is to try the ultimate boot CD for windows to ge a keyboard up and running.

    <Summary_2>This question is in regard to Windows XP product key from dual boot machine. The OEM sticker is no longer on the machine and user would like to use current legal product key for the reinstall. It is to do with ubuntu though because user using it for data recovery. Safe mode isn't an option most likely due to conflicting drivers or a registry corruption. The solution provided is partial from  http://magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/ as the user is unable to use mouse or keyboard when in Windows and that tool is in Windows only. User should be able to run it in wine but real windows hive is not held in wine drive so it will be looking in the wrong place.

    <Title>Kernel Panic - VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0)</Title>

    <Body> Hi   I recently got Ubuntu (Ibex) and I started noticing that if I left the computer on for long periods of time (overnight) in the morning, the screen would freeze with just the Desktop image displaying.  now, I know that when the system freezes you want it to shutdown 'gracefully' unfortunately, Ubuntu does not recognize my keyboard's SySrq key. The key is [FN] + delete. However, it is recognized as  quot;prt sc quot; (as is the actual prt sc) I have a compaq presario V6000, 88 keys, 101 compatible... and so on.   Usually when I hard reset, the computer is fine, however, now I get Code:  1.484036 RAMDisk: Compressed image found at block 0 1.890479 - list of all partitions: 1.890536 No filesystem could mount root, tried: cramfs 1.891310 Kernel Panic - not syncing:VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0)  I assume this is due to not being able to use Alt + Sysrq R,E,I,S,U,B - so the disk doesn't sync...  If you can help me on any one of these parts, I would greatly appreciate it (though I think I'll need to be able to startup Ubuntu to troubleshoot the 2nd and 1st Parts...  Thanks in advance </Body>

    <Summary_1>The user recently got Ubuntu (Ibex) and was experiencing a problem in which the screen would freeze if the computer was left unused for long period of time. Whenever the computer got freeze, the Ubuntu does not recognized the keyboard's SySrq key. The key was [FN]+delete. The computer was able to recognize it as prt sc. The user had a compaq presario V6000, 88 keys, 101 compatible.  Whenever user did hard reset, the computer was fine but however when the user code:1.484036 RAMDisk: Compressed image found at block 0 1.890479 - list of all partitions: 1.890536 No file system could mount root, tried: cramfs 1.891310 Kernel Panic - not syncing:VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0). The user assumed the problem was due to not being able to use Alt + Sysrq R,E,I,S,U,B - so the disk doesn't synchronize. The solution to the problem is to boot the system into older kernel which can be done just after bios boot, select kernel anme with lower number in grub menu. The other problem observed was when the user boot from the latest kernel, after the normal scrolling of stuff starting up the screen shows the previous error data, then clears the screen and prints (paraphrased) - Boot from ext3, starting up... then Code: Then the whole "VFS: Unable to mount" thing  The other user had a similar problem. The user had the linux mint which was a clean install and was not able to access linux. The user had an access to linux partition but can&#8217;t use any command from linux. The peculiar bug was present which made boot folder repeat itself lot of times or something. The trick of using a previous kernel worked with Linux version 2.6.27-11-generic (buildd@vernadsky) (gcc version 4.3.2 (Ubuntu 4.3.2-1ubuntu11) #1 SMP Wed Apr 1 20:57:48 UTC 2009. The kernel version which had troubles was Linux version 2.6.27-14-generic (buildd@palmer) (gcc version 4.3.2 (Ubuntu 4.3.2-1ubuntu12) ) #1 SMP Wed Apr 15 18:59:16 UTC 2009 (Ubuntu 2.6.27-14.33-generic). The following messages observed were bad gzip image and magic number.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to unable to mount roof fs on unknown-block (0,0). The user keyboard is unable to recognize by Ubuntu (Ibex) which runs from live cd after the computer is ON for long periods of time and the system is freeze only "prt sc" is working in the keyboard. This can be resolved by trying to boot into older kernel with select kernel name with lower number in grub menu. This is work around than a solution. The user kernel is 2.6.27-11 is working fine after some updates.</Summary_2>

      <Owner> Thank you sisco311. Disaster has been averted. Turns out that I had only managed to change the read permission of / therefore the first command you suggested worked like a charm.  For all posters out there that suggest to reinstall as soon as they see the numbers 777: read up or shut up. And read the sticky of this section:  gt; gt; Telling people to reinstall for every issue is not acceptable.  lt; lt; I saved an awful lot of time by asking the right questions and not rushing to the solution. I'm no linux expert but thankfully I had the right feeling about this one.  I hope this thread will help someone in the future.  Thanks to everyone. </Owner>

      <Owner> To justify myself: as stated I was tired and did make a mistake. However, to expect that a linux intermediate user (let's call them normal users) is supposed to know exactly what they execute in the terminal is not viable, mainly because irc, these forums and many other pages give lists of commands, usually to solve problems, that the users will go and execute blindfolded. They trust these commands because they do not understand enough of the problem to solve it themselves and have been advised to do so by a person.  To justify your answer: Linux users that open up a terminal should indeed know a short list of the no-no commands. I know what the chmod 777 command does in principle and avoid it like the plague, however in this case it was supposed to be run for an external HD. Again, it was my mistake. I should have been more careful.  A more neutral comment: Independently of carelessness of users or help-posters (whether it was for executing a command without thinking twice, or not reading the full post, analysing it carefully and then giving advice), I believe that the forums are a great resource for information and help. If this experience has taught me anything (and not the hard way, thankfully, this time) it is that I can wait and have a bit more patience and seek second opinions when it comes to deciding on an answer to solve the problem... and not execute sudo chmod 777 in root, of course.  Thank you all. </Owner>

    <Title>Low Graphics Mode - Borked Driver? Xorg.conf?</Title>
    <Owner>brendanodork</Owner>
    <Body> Hola!  I've got a laptop (Compaq V2000) that's been running ubuntu (Hardy) nicely out of the box. I tried to get fancy and install the ati video drivers for it so that i could get svideo out to my TV. Got it working for a while (downloaded from the ATI site), was playing around with many different settings trying to get it to work the way i wanted it. I didn't keep particularly good track of what i was doing and at some point, the laptop started booting into what it calmly and repetitively informs me is Low Graphics Mode because it cannot detect my defice. So that's sad. At some point in there i upgraded to Intrepid. :-/ Too many upgrades at once - i know i shouldn't have.  I tried all of the  quot;fix me quot; options in Recovery Mode. I tried replacing /etc/X11/xorg.conf with a few different ones, including a very empty-looking one, and the one that results when i type  quot;sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p high xserver-xorg quot;. I replaced it with one that was (i believe) marked  quot;xorg.conf.original quot; from recovery mode, and that worked very nicely...once. When i rebooted, back to low graphics mode. Further replacements do not seem to be yielding me any results.  Does this sound familiar to anyone? Is there a diagnostic path that seems useful to someone? I was next going to try making a live CD to make sure it really was my system that was borked rather than the hardware parts.  Thanks! - Brendan </Body>
    <Summary_1>The user had a laptop (Compaq V2000) that's been running ubuntu (Hardy) properly.The user tried to install the ati video drivers so that he/she could get svideo out to a TV. Got it working for a while (downloaded from the ATI site), was playing around with many different settings trying to get it to work the way the user wanted it. The user  didn't keep particularly good track of what he/she was doing and at some point, the laptop started booting into what it calmly and repetitively informs the user is Low Graphics Mode because it cannot detect the user's device. At some point in there the user  upgraded to Intrepid. :-/ Too many upgrades at once - i know i shouldn't have. The user tried all of the "fix me" options in Recovery Mode. The user tried replacing /etc/X11/xorg.conf with a few different ones, including a very empty-looking one, and the one that results when the user typed "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p high xserver-xorg". The user replaced it with one that was marked "xorg.conf.original" from recovery mode, and that worked very nicely once. When the user rebooted, it was back to low graphics mode.

    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to after installing the ATI video drivers to get svideo out by that time sysyem started booting and went to a Low Graphice Mode. Further, on  replacing /etc/X11/xorg.conf with a  "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p high xserver-xorg" and one marked with "xorg.conf.original" from recovery mode, resolved for once. But upon rebooted, back to low graphics mode. This is yet to be resolved.</Summary_2>

      <Owner> You could technically download the GParted Live-CD, burn it, then boot it. You can grab the Live-CD right here http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php. If you already have Ubuntu installed, which I'm assuming you do, you need to find the NTFS or FAT32 partitions, delete those partitions, then resize your ext3 partition to your liking. Now if you don't already have Ubuntu installed, you can always pop in the Ubuntu Live-CD and select  quot;Guided Partition: Use entire disk quot; and that will just install Ubuntu over Windows, it's really your choice. </Owner>

      <Owner> I already have Ubuntu installed and when I was trying to find info on how to do this before making this thread, I kept finding all this info about partitions. Now, I'm kind of a n00b when it comes to installing another entire OS. Where I'm going with that is... I have no idea what a partition is or where to find it.   So with Ubuntu already installed, I just need to find the two partitions stated above and delete them? Where do I find them and how far should I expand the remaining one? </Owner>

      <Owner> Can you please post the results of this command?  Code: Once I or someone else has seen that command, we can help you further. If you do not know what a partition is, I recommend you reading this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning. You need to find the NTFS or FAT32 partition, once you download the GParted Live-CD. Then you have the option to delete the NTFS/FAT32 partition and resize your ext3 partition to what you want. Another thing you can do is once your in the GParted Live-CD take a screenshot and again I or someone else can help you further. </Owner>

      <Owner> Well, it looks like you have deleted your windows partition, but I didn't see any linux partition in your fdisk output. How did you install ubuntu? Did you use wubi to start the installation from within windows? In that case ubuntu was installed within your windows partition, which means it is gone now. You need to install ubuntu again.  The other partitions on your hard drive seem to be dell's utility partition and some dell restore partition. I guess the restore partition can be used to restore windows, so you may want to keep it in case you decide you need windows, unless you have a real windows install cd and a valid licence... If you want to keep those partitions, just let ubuntu use the rest of the space on the hard drive without touching the other partitions. If you don't want to keep them, make sure you remove them before you start to install ubuntu, and just let the ubuntu installer use the entire hard drive. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user wanted to remove Windows as he/she installed Ubuntu from the system. The registry of the windows was beyond repair. The user could technically download the GParted Live-CD, burn it, then boot it. The user can get information from the website http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php. Since the Ubuntu was installed, the user need to find the NTFS or FAT32 partitions, need to delete those partitions, then resize an ext3 partition according to the requirement.   The user was recommended to read the webpage http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning. to know about the partition and was asked to post the results of the command.

      <Owner> so, system got spontaneously buggy? from my experience, linux systems don't do that, and if there's nothing else to remember and identify as possible cause I'll just press the restart button and wait for a reboot, if you get trouble booting/logging then we could discuss, but before pressing the restart button try just restarting the x-server by pressing ctrl+alt+backspace, anyway, that's just what I would do. </Owner>

    <Owner>lordofduct</Owner>
    <Body> Ok for starters I'm running two X screens right now.  That is two independent screens on which I can NOT drag stuff back and forth between the two, the monitors are two different sizes and resolutions so I can't stretch across nicely.  I use my main monitor for work, programming, and general stuff. Yes I'm slightly new to Unix.  My left monitor is for multimedia and minor things. It's where I open up Rhythmbox and Pidgin. If I want to watch a movie while working I put it on the left monitor. All that little stuff.  The thing is this also means that my remote control is usually controlling something on my left monitor as well. But it is used for MythTv on the main monitor (it's the larger of the two at 30 inches, yey TV).      SOOOOOO  my question.  I'm configuring lirc to open up and control rhythmbox.  my config file for test purposes looks like this so far:   Code: Just a few basic commands.  The thing is it only starts rhythmbox on the main screen, and the play or pause commands only work IF rhythmbox is on the main screen. If I manually open it on the left one, and push buttons, rhythmbox never receives the commands.  What can I do to direct it over to the left screen???? </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> i'm assuming it's something to do with what I type in the  quot;config quot; command or something... err, not sure...  is there a way in a terminal window to select which screen a graphical app opens? I know the screen numbers of each X display. </Owner>

      <Owner> I just tried it tonight for the first time following the guide and it worked fine. Thanks for the tip. Ubuntu 8.10, Evolution 2.24.3. We run inside Google Apps for domain.  However, I do have a problem that seems to be recognized in your posts as well and that is with the calendar.  I can see SOME of my events on my calendar inside Evolution but not all and certainly not repeating. I do get to see events that I have been invited to by colleagues too...pretty funny that some public events show and others don't.  Any suggestions anyone? Evolution would clearly be my choice but I live on my calendar app.  Thanks in advance. </Owner>

When I sync with gmail contacts, however, (using this guide: http://www.linux.com/news/software/a...ogles-pim-apps) I get full name field and nothing else even though my gmail contacts are fully filled out.

      <Owner> thought i might add my 2 cents to this: for you guys who've gotten this to work, does evolution sync with 'all contacts' in gmail?  mine does this, but it's not ideal, i'd rather get it to sync with 'my contacts' so that it doesn't store addresses of every single person i've emailed...  any thoughts? </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user wanted Evolution to use his/her gmail contacts as an online address book. The user tried following the guide but when the user used the address book, error was observed. The user was able to import contacts as v-card but was not able to use Gmail imap and Google Calendar. The user tried finding a solution from google but was unable to find it. The other user also had the same problem. The user was not able to synchronize the Evolution with Google mail contacts and observed the same error. The problem was observed on 32-bit Intrepid as well as on a 64-bit system with evolution 2.24.3-0ubuntu1 evolution-data-server 2.24.3-0ubuntu1 One of the users followed the guide and it worked for him/her. The user had ubuntu 8.10, evolution 2.24.3. The user had a problem with the recognization of the post and calendar. The user observed some of the events on the calendar inside the Evolution but not all and certainly not repeating. Some of the shared events were observed but not some were missing inside the Evolution. One of the users thought that it was not ideal to synchronize evolution with all contacts but it would be better to synchronize it with my contacts so that it doesn&#8217;t store addresses of every email contact.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to problems syncing gmail contacts as an online address book with Evolution. Perhaps, upgrading to Evolution 2.26.1 resolves the syncing with google contacts, google calendars etc.</Summary_2>

      <Owner> Howdy,  in terminal, type sudo gparted  if its not installed, type   sudo apt-get install gparted  gparted can wipe any type of partition and with relative ease. just make sure you do wipe the partition you intend to, as you can fubar your drive if you get rid of the wrong thing.  Hope this helps, and definitely ask more questions if you aren't sure this is what you want and what you are doing. </Owner>

      <Owner> wow, thats a ton of partitions, crazy thats how they come.   I would remove all partitions that arent the XP partition, then extend the xp partition to fill the space after it, and install ubuntu on the other side of the drive.  BUT, not sure if once you remove those partitions you'll be able to boot into xp till you get ubuntu installed and it installs grub for boot loading, so once you do the next step, be ready to roll.  Also, it may tell you it cant remove partitions when in the OS, and if so, boot into the ubuntu live cd and deal with it from there. </Owner>

      <Owner> sda2 looks to be it. The other ntfs partition is likely a recovery partition for XP.  If you want to make sure, boot into XP, use XP's partition manager to see what size and format your XP partition is- and more than likely its NTFS and around the size of sda2. </Owner>

      <Owner> Yup, right click my computer, click manage, then on left pane click disc management. Not as full featured as gparted, but it shows the same drive labels you see when you are in the my computer screen, so you'll be able to verify wich is wich.  It wont let you extend the drive to fill the space, but it will let you delete partitions at least. </Owner>

If you want to do it before hand, you can use gparted to do it before, but really thats no faster or better (no good reason to not just let ubuntu do it during install.

    <Summary_1>How to wipe ubuntu partition? The user is currently having dual booting with easy peasy and XP and is facing problems. The user want to completely wipe off the partition and wants to install bog-standard jaunty. User can do this by gparted which can wipe any type of partition. gparted can be installed by typing 'sudo apt-get install gparted' in terminal. gparted will only wipe the partition which user is intended to do. The other ways to do it are (1) dban. Download dban from 'http://www.dban.org/' It can be downloaded as iso and transfer it to a disc which further can be used to wipe all the hard drives including XP partition.(2) Gparted live cd/ubuntu live cd can also be used for this purpose. There is other ntfs partion likely a recovery partition for XP. XP has a partition manager which can be useful for creating partition. XP partition can be accessed by right clicking my computer then click manage and then on left pane click disc management. XP partition is not full featured as gparted but it shows the same drive labels and it won&#8217;t extend the drive to fill the space but will allow you to delete the partitions It is better to use XP Partition compare to gparted as it is safe and will not destroy windows. As a precaution, back up all the data and install jaunty. Jaunty installation can be done using live Cd.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is regard to wipe only ubuntu partitions keep XP partition intact and install Jaunty. This is resolved as follows:in terminal, type sudo gparted if its not installed, type sudo apt-get install gparted gparted can wipe any type of partition and with relative ease. Just have make sure to wipe the partition user intend to, and can fubar the drive if by chance get rid of the wrong thing. Elaboration is provided in http://www.dban.org/ and download the iso, burn it to a disc, reboot, and watch your hard-drive disappear. If to flatten it then choose the fastest method, all zeroes.To tell which ones are XP sda2 looks to be it. The other ntfs partition is likely a recovery partition for XP. If user want to make sure, boot into XP, use XP's partition manager to see what size and format XP partition is- and more than likely its NTFS and around the size of sda2. XP has a partition manager and can be located by  right click my computer, click manage, then on left pane click disc management. Not as full featured as gparted, but it shows the same drive labels when in the my computer screen, so one will be able to verify which is which. It wont let extend the drive to fill the space, but it will let the user to delete partitions at least. Now the user can delete the ubuntu partitions from there. Sometime later, if user want to wipe all the XP partition and install jaunty this can be resolved as following: Create a back up and  then insert a Jaunty CD and boot from it and during install, select Guided Use entire hard drive. No need to do erase it within the live CD, just once click to install it, it'll be one of the pages that comes up during the install.

    <Body> After adding songs to my MP3 player, I went to check to make sure everything sounded OK. When I played the songs on Rhythmbox, Exhaile, and Amarok, a majority of the songs skipped in various locations. I checked them in Microsoft Media Player (ugh), and none of the songs skipped. Is there a media player available in Linux that doesn't skip? Or am I just being too much of a perfectionist? Thanks for any assistance. </Body>

      <Owner> Pemur1, I would be curious to know what kind of machine you are using, and what kind of audio adapter.  I am having the same problem when playing mp3's (perhaps other audio, as well) using a Dell Mini 9 (Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)).  For me, this problem did not surface until some time in the last few weeks. Prior to that, I'd had no issues at all. </Owner>

      <Owner> Skipping takes place with mplayer, as it does with any other player.  Just to experiment, I just tried installing a few other players that do not use gstreamer to see how well they might do. I tried xfmedia and even banshee. Neither of them would play mp3's at all, to my very great surprise.  I have all the codecs, etc. installed, and as I mentioned earlier, up until a few weeks ago, I had no issues with audio on this Mini 9 at all. </Owner>

      <Owner>  Quote: I totally disagree. I know that some people have issues with it, but it works absolutely fantastic for me.  It probably depends on what audio hardware you have. But I get audio mixed from all my applications (including WINE).  The OP's problem is likely hardware related or the audio driver for their specific hardware.  My audio never skips, even when running all 4 cores to the max. </Owner>

      <Owner> If you're playing the mp3 files from a USB drive, then you should be aware that a bug in Ubuntu causes USB 2.0 devices to run at USB 1.0 speeds in some cases. There are numerous bug reports on this and apparently the bug has existed since Ibex. I had this problem with the stock kernel and the new 2.6.30 kernel and went back to the 2.6.29.5 kernel to solve it. If installing a new kernel is out of your league, then as a band-aide measure, you could use Audacious and define a large buffer. Do this as follows:  1. Launch Audacious 2. left-click the small square in the upper left-hand corner of the player window 3. Select preferences; then the audio icon on the left of the resulting window 4. Change the Buffer size to something like 1000 (play with it until the skipping stops.)  Good luck! </Owner>

      <Owner> Pulse has always worked for me, I am now happy to be back to it after some bad experience with Kubuntu's sound. I get good sound using wine + virtual box + Audacious at the same time.  If the Linus system is set up properly, sound doesn't skip, that is why I said that it must be a driver/setting issue. </Owner>

      <Owner> I wound up following Th3_uN1Qu3's advice, and removing pulseaudio.   I am not sure why I didn't decide to do this earlier, considering that I have been trying to correct this problem for several hours now, and had already had a very long and dysfunctional relationship with pulseaudio.  This appears to have solved all of my audio issues. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user had problem with adding songs to the MP3 player. When the user tried to play the songs on Rhythmbox, Exhaile and Amarok, a majority of the songs skipped in various locations but when checked with Microsoft Media Player, none of the songs skipped. User wanted to find a media player for linux that does not skip the music files. Songbird is a music player with no problem of skipping files. The problem can be due to a sound driver rather than any particular software issue. Similar problem had been observed with Exhaile software but using Banshee software had no such issues. The other user had a same problem and was curious to know the machine configuration of the user who had posted the question on the thread. Similar problem has been experienced with the software xfmedia, mplayer and banshee. Mp3 files operated from USB drive can create this problem which can be due to a bug in Ubuntu which causes USB 2.0 devices to run at USB 1.0 speeds in some cases. Similar problem had been observed with the stock kernel. The other solution to this problem can be the use of Audacious and defining a large buffer. This can be done my launching audacious then left clicking the small square in the upper let-hand corner of the player window and select preferences and then select the audio icon on the left of the resulting window and change the buffer size. Play the music files until it stops skipping. The problem was solved by the removal of pulseaudio. It was not a driver issue.</Summary_1>

Your feedback and suggestion to further enhance the customization will be highly appreciated. You might be already doing the same with little different steps.

      <Owner> Just thought I'd pop in to mention a few things: 1. For Gutsy, there are patches to Nautilus 2.20 to make it render icons over a clear background, but not for Nautilus 2.22. Blame the GNOME devs for making massive changes to libeel. 2. We (Compiz) no longer support the Cube background drawing, and it has been removed in the git version. 3. We've thrown our support over a newly rewritten Wallpaper plugin, which works even if you don't use the cube. </Owner>

    <Title>ATI Radeon x700: no desktop effects</Title>
    <Owner>Methuselah</Owner>
    <Body> I don't want to use xgl so that's not a solution for me. Also the proprietary ati driver does very bad things to my machine so it's not an option either. I've had compiz working (with an ati 9600 using the ati driver) under both freebsd and gutsy. I guessing it should work with the x700 under hardy because the card is listed as being quite well supported on the Xorg website.   However, running compiz gives:   Quote: My xorg.conf is below. Not sure what the extra sections below the ServerLayout are for. I only have one screen and video card.   Quote: My first unix-like system was freebsd and I have to say, I find ubuntu harder to deal with when things don't work as they should. The display is supposed to be autoconfigured for you so you're not quite sure what to do when it breaks down. I didn't even have widescreen resolutions after I installed and the tool from gutsy that allows you to choose your monitor type was nowhere to be found in the menus. Eventually, I got widescreen working by running that tool. Right now, I'm not even sure if I'm free to edit my xorg.conf or whether it will confuse an tool that already edits it. Any guidance will be appreciated! </Body>

    <Title>Screen blinks black and I am returned to the login screen</Title>
    <Owner>Ingo88</Owner>
    <Body> I am experiencing a rather weird and very annoying problem in Ubuntu (Hardy). I did experience this in Gutsy too, but not as often as in Hardy.  Sometimes, at completely random occasions (while burning a cd with K3b, while reading my webmail in firefox etc.) the screen goes black for a second, returns to normal for a second, and then suddenly I am brought back to the login screen. This sure could be enraging especially if I'd have some unsaved documents or e-mail messages open when it happens. Luckily I haven't been that unfortunate yet.  When I upgraded to Hardy I first tried to install Kubuntu as I mostly use KDE apps (K3b, digiKam, Gwenview), but there I was kicked back to the login screen about all the time. Besides, it was way slower than Ubuntu.  Any clues what the problem might be? I intend to use Hardy throughout the LTS period, but I sure can't live with problems like this.

It's not even long ago I installed Hardy. Maybe sometime in August... It was 8.04.1 anyhow. I don't see why it's so slow either. Neither the CPU usage nor the memory usage seem high when the system feels awfully slow. Especially at startup (the gnome panel takes forever to load, and sometimes some applets fail to load).

    <Title>change the close button location</Title>
    <Owner>hydraulicjj</Owner>
    <Body> Hi. does anyone know how i can change the location of the close button in ubuntu hardy so that it is like on osx? </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> I do not know where it is located on OSX, but ...  The quit button is actually a  quot;launcher quot; called Quit and can be put anywhere a launcher can go.  For example to add one to the bottom panel, right-click the panel and choose  quot;Add to Panel quot; and select  quot;Quit quot; from the list.  Likewise if you are using AWN, add the Quit launcher to the AWN panel. </Owner>

      <Owner> I think he's talking about the window-decorator close button...  You can do this with the emerald theme manager, assuming you use emerald as your window decorator...    Which function to specify with which letter you can make up with the help below. Starting left, the first : makes is centered, the next : right aligned.  Just take the window as an example,  Code:  is mine at the beginning, and you can see, left aligned I got the icon as well as the window title, nothing centered here, and then the other 4 functions, ANXC for set above, minimize, etc...  you may use spacers as well simply by adding the count of pixels the space should have in brackets.  I(10)T::ANXC would leave 10 pixels of space between the icon and the title.  Hope this is actually answering your question ^^ </Owner>

      <Owner> There is a way to change it without using Emerald.  Hit alt and F2 which will bring up the run application dialogue. From there you type in  Code: and hit enter. from there all you need to do is hit ctrl and f and search for metacity, click the link that says /apps/metacity/general and then scroll down to button_layout. just click on the right side where it says menu:etc and then to get it like a mac you would have it be close,minimize,maximize:menu </Owner>

    <Title>Can Permissions Bollix Java Runtime Environment?</Title>
    <Owner>psuliin</Owner>
    <Body> I recently had a system glitch that disabled my $HOME/.dmrc directory. I managed to get my home directory back under my ownership with 644 privileges, and went on about my business. Then a couple of days later (today) I noticed that a website that required Java wasn't running right.   I checked Firefox's preferences and  quot;Enable Java quot; is checked. My Java Runtime Environment is installed - and it was working a week or so ago when I visited this same website. However I went back to my firefox and java directories (the former is in my /usr/lib directory and the latter in my home directory) and noticed that the ownership of the directories is different: $HOME/java is owned by me (as it should be since I changed the ownership of my home directory back to myself recently), but /usr/lib/firefox-3.0.4 is owned by root.  The normal process of enabling Java involved placing a link to my JRE (in $HOME/java) in my firefox folder. Did changing ownership of that $HOME/java folder while leaving my firefox folder with root break that link? </Body>
    <Summary_1>The user had an ownership issue with the Java. Even though, the user had permission to enable java files for firefox but it was noticed that the ownership of the java directories were different. The user wanted to know whether the changing ownership of the home folder while leaving the firefox folder with root break that link.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to changing ownership of that $HOME/java folder while leaving firefox folder with root lead to break that link.

    <Title>Firefox 3.0.1 starts gconfd under KDE</Title>
    <Owner>mtrainer</Owner>
    <Body> Hi,  I am running KDE 3.5.10 on Kubuntu 8.04 64-bit. Whenever I start Firefox 3.0.1 it automatically starts gconfd if it is installed. The only way to stop that is to remove the package containing gconfd (libgconf2-4). This also requires that I remove dia and inkscape. The funny thing is that running dia and inkscape don't start gconfd. Is there any way I can stop firefox from using gconfd if it is installed so I can leave dia and inkscape installed?  Thanks  Murray </Body>

    <Title>passwd Problem - can't log on</Title>
    <Owner>Chebyshev</Owner>
    <Body> I just upgraded to 8.10 2 days ago and it was working fine. Just now, I tried to get samba working properly again and something got screwy with my user account. Trying to change my password using passwd produces a segfault. If I boot into recovery mode, the same thing happens. I can make a new account and change its password just fine.  When I try to log on in gdm, it seems to crash and restart itself. If I try to log on from the console, it just doesn't log me on and re-presents the logon prompt with no information. The same thing happens if I try to log on as root (I made a root password in recovery mode). If I boot to recovery mode and su to my username, it works fine.  I tried deleting my user account and re-adding it, but passwd still fails for that account name.  Any ideas? </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> After more fooling around, I've found the following:  A regular boot doesn't allow any user to log on, including root. The logon fails with no message and if using gdm, it crashes and restarts itself.  A recovery mode boot allows me to log on a root and su to whatever user I want. If I try to do anything using passwd on my original username, passwd segfaults, but it works on any other username, including root.  I'm completely mystified. </Owner>

    <Title>USB problems that I can't seem to fix!</Title>
    <Owner>ashleydangerous</Owner>
    <Body> Basically, I'm using Ubuntu 8.10 and have a USB headset that will randomly stop working and refuse to work again until I reboot, even after I plug it back in (the red power light won't even go on.) I also have a USB webcam that won't work at all, even though it used to work just fine.  I've tried:Adding uhci_hcd to the modprobe blacklist Reinstalling any packages I could find relating to USB Running Skype and webcam apps with the LD_PRELOAD commands recommended in the stickied ibex post  None of these seem to help at all  I'd really appreciate the help, as I spend a lot of time teleconferencing with coworkers and these USB problems are really becoming problematic.  Please let me know if you have any ideas, and I will try to implement them.  Thanks a ton!  </Body>

      <Owner> Maybe if you can post some related dmesg information and lsusb we could be more help. Are you using ports on the front or back because even though I have new computer my front ports will not work with some things properly like webcam and external drive. Not sure why. </Owner>

      <Owner> Hello! I tried plugging the webcam into the back port of the computer, and the same thing happens -- Skype shows a garbled green screen. I installed cheese, and the video seems to work there.  I searched the forums, and tried:  LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skype  but the garbled greenness is still there in Skype.  Anyways, here is the information from the commands you mentioned! The headset hasn't decided to stop working on its own yet, but when it does I will check dmesg and report back.

    <Title>Lightspeed NXT on Wubi Ubuntu</Title>
    <Owner>I am generic</Owner>
    <Body> So I've convinced my mom to install wubi ubuntu for her work computer due to its lower maintenance requirements compared to windows. This is just a temporary thing to see if she prefers linux over windows however since this is a work computer it requires certain software that is required for her business to run properly, Lightspeed NXT. Now I have been looking for a tutorial but can't find one and frankly there is a kink in getting this paticular bit of software to run correctly. It requires the Lightspeed NXT people to be able to connect to the windows remote desktop client which obviously throws a monkey wrench into the whole linux idea. Now I'm hoping that anybody that has experience running the lightspeed nxt client will hit me up with some info on how to get this paticular program to run on wubi ubuntu. Make sure to assume that I am stupid and use small syllable words and walk me through every little bit because I'm a bit slow when it comes to linux and don't actually run this on my home computer. I'm mostly installing linux on this machine for the low upkeep and unlikeliness of viruses. </Body>
    <Summary_1>Lightspeed NXT on Wubi Ubuntu The user is switching the system's Os from windows to linux to reduce the maintenance requirements.

    <Title>new server installation hp proliant dl145</Title>
    <Owner>emergencydpt</Owner>
    <Body> Hi. I got a proliant dl145 server from a garage sale. It's not working of course. I don't know what  quot;g quot; number it is, if any. I don't think it's a g2 or 3 but may be a plain dl145 or possibly a g1. Does anyone know how to tell the difference between these hp proliant servers from looking at them?  It will not consistantly boot up. I can boot it up to the bios and get it to pass post if I reset cmos. However it won't do it a second time unless I again reset it.  I downloaded the ubutu server edition and made a cd but it won't boot up. Perhaps I did it wrong. I dl the files to my desktop then I extracted everything to a disk. Is that correct? I don't think so because when I look at the disk I see further zipped files on deeper file levels.  Soooo. 1. How to find out if ubutu will run on my server...what server do I have? 2. Step by step instructions for creating a disk the server will boot to and install the OS. 3. Why is it not booting consistantly? I note there is a missing box on the back right side where something plugs in...could it be the server management processor and that's why it doesn't boot?  Thanks for your help.  PS I want to make a home server to store all my movies on. What else do I need? A graphics card with hdmi to plug into my TV? A sound card? Or should it serve out to another computer that handles this at the tv? Obviously I don't want to spend money on this if something is wrong.  -EmergencyDpt </Body>

    <Body> Hello, I have read lot's of things about how you can use SSH to tell your home computer to download a file while you're at work or whatever but is their anyway to start downloading a file, log out of SSH and get back to whatever and still have the remote computer download the file using wget?  Thanks in advance! </Body>

      <Owner> Use FreeNX, it will maintain a session on the server even when you are not logged in.  http://freenx.berlios.de/download.php </Owner>

      <Owner> Another way you can do it is to write a shell script like:   Code: The first line is part of shell scripting -- it tells the program where the shell is  The second line,  quot;sleep 10 quot;, tells the terminal to  quot;sleep quot; for 10 seconds, thus delaying wget.  You can run that with the command  quot;sh shellscripthere  amp; quot; The  quot; amp; quot; tells it to run it in the background. You then can log out and in 10 seconds the file will start downloading.  Have a nice day! </Owner>

      <Owner> There's also apt://screen. Start a screen by running  Code:  Then run whatever (non-gui) program you like inside screen, and detach the screen by hitting ctrl+a+d or simply closing the terminal window. The program(s) you run in screen will keep running in the background after you detach. To get back to the program(s), log back in to the server and run the following to reattach  Code: . You can run several screens at a time, and you can have several windows inside the screen, so you can run several programs inside the screen at the same time. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user needed information about downloading the file with the remote computer using wget without logging out of SSH. FreeNX was the software which can be used as it will maintain a session on the server even when the user was not logged in. The information could be found on a following webpage. http://freenx.berlios.de/download.php The other was to write a shell script like: Code: The first line is part of shell scripting -- it tells the program where the shell is The second line, "sleep 10", tells the terminal to "sleep" for 10 seconds, thus delaying wget.A user can run that with the command "sh shellscripthere &amp;" The "&amp;" tells it to run it in the background. A user then can log out and in 10 seconds the file will start downloading. The another was apt://screen. Start a screen by running Code: Then run whatever (non-gui) program which a user like inside screen, and detach the screen by hitting ctrl+a+d or simply closing the terminal window. The program(s) a user run in screen will keep running in the background after you detach. To get back to the program(s), log back in to the server and run the following to reattach Code: . A user can run several screens at a time, and you can have several windows inside the screen, so you can run several programs inside the screen at the same time.

    <Summary_2>This discussion in regard to how one can use SSH to tell home computer to download a file while someone is at work using wget. In other words, is their anyway to start downloading a file, log out of SSH and get back to it and still have the remote computer download the file using wget. The solutions provided are as follows: 1) Use FreeNX, it will maintain a session on the server even when the user is not logged in. http://freenx.berlios.de/download.php. 2) Another way the user can do it is to write a shell script like: Code: The first line is part of shell scripting -- it tells the program where the shell is The second line, "sleep 10", tells the terminal to "sleep" for 10 seconds, thus delaying wget. The user can run that with the command "sh shellscripthere &amp;" The "&amp;" tells it to run it in the background. Then user can log out and in 10 seconds the file will start downloading. 3) There's also apt://screen. Start a screen by running Code: Then run any non-gui program user like inside screen, and detach the screen by hitting ctrl+a+d or simply closing the terminal window. The program(s) the user run in screen will keep running in the background after user detach. To get back to the program(s), user can log back in to the server and run the following to reattach Code: . User can run several screens at a time, and have several windows inside the screen, so that user can run several programs inside the screen at the same time. 4) Basically, SSH is a way of connecting securely to a computer. User can setup an ssh server on computer for e.g. openssh is very popular (configuration link: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-...configuration/ Wget is a command line utility to download things from the web. For further reference: http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl1_wget.htm; once, the user install ssh then its like working on local computer via terminal (using terminal one can familiar with common unix commands from the sources like http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)</Summary_2>
