    <Title>Recommendations needed for a lunch spot</Title>
    <Owner>mrspopeye</Owner>
    <Body>     We are a family of four with kids ages 14 and 10 and will be coming for a short visit in mid-October. One day we plan to see SOL/Ellis Island in the morning and Central Park and Museum of Natural History in the afternoon.    I am looking for a lunch spot somewhere near Battery Park before we board the subway to go uptown or a place in the Upper West Side, where we will arrive. I have looked extensively at menupages, but so many things that fit our needs have bad reviews! Looking for American food (pizza included), preferably with a kids menu, no white tablecloth types or ethnic cuisine, under $20-25 a person.    Can anyone help? Thanks.   </Body>

      <Owner>     Shake Shack near the museum would probably be right up your alley.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     I hate to burst your bubble, but the day you have planned is totally unrealistic. It will take 4-5 hrs. minimum to tour SOL/Ellis Island and by then you'll be exhausted. Your best bet is probably to eat at Ellis Island or near Battery Park on your return and forget about the museum. Gigino's Wagner Park is an Italian rest. with views of the Statue. They also have a kids' menu.  menupages.com/restaurants/gigino-wagner-park/    Maybe the kids will be interested in going to the park after lunch, but I'd suggest doing something else downtown in the afternoon. Maybe head over to the lower east side to the Tenement Museum and then to Economy Candy.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     NYWhiz makes a good point, as always. Also, have you booked your tickets for the SOL and Ellis Island yet? Crown tickets are very hard to get unless you book far in advance.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Another recent addition to that area is Inatteso on West Street--- It is an upscale pizza place and owned by the same people as Adrienne's on Stone street that always gets good grades. I have been thoroughly disappointed in Gigino's the last few times there even though if you sit outside having the SOL in your sites is pretty cool. One other suggestion would be Zetuna's which is more like you described but no pizza--   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Wow! Thanks for the quick responses. Yes, we knew to get our crown tickets already, thanks to many months of lurking on this forum. We secured our tickets back in June and I am very glad.     The Tenement Museum and Economy Candy sounds like a great idea too. My kids may not want to see the Natural History museum anyway after 5 days in Washington DC prior to our arrival there. We actually had planned 7 days in DC and I wanted so much to go up to the crown, so we decided to do 5 in DC and 2 in NYC. I will be doing a lot of scouting around to plan a much longer trip in the near future.    Thanks for all the restaurant suggestions. I am so overwhemed by how much NYC has to offer. I will look into all of them.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I wouldn't reco Gigino's in Wagner Park if you're looking for a casual place with pizza. It's a gorgeous restaurant with great food and a great view, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't sound like what you're looking for.    Instead, if you're going to eat after the SOL/Ellis, I'd reco P.J. Clarke's or SouthwestNY, which are both in the World Financial Center and more casual.    On the UWS, I always reco Big Nick's Pizza and Burgers for folks with kids, on B'way near 77th Street. It's ain't the prettiest place, but the menu is endless and their burgers are big, juicy and cheap! A real crowd-pleaser.    www.menupages.com/restaurants/big-nicks/    Another good place for kids and adults is Vynl. I personally prefer the original location on 9th Aenue, but the others are fine. Great bathrooms, good food, good cocktails.    www.vynl-nyc.com    NOTE: NO FREE REFILLS ON SODA/POP OR ICED TEA IN NYC!! It's just not customary here. I have no idea why; that's just the way it is.    In NYC, it's common to get free refills on our (healthy and tasty) tap water, and on hot coffee or tea. (Yep, no need to waste $$ on bottle water. Bring your own bottle and fill from the tap.)   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>Mrs Popeye and her family were coming for a short visit in mid-October. They planned to see SOL/Ellis island, Central Park and Museum of Natural History. She was looking for a lunch spot near Battery Park which can be close to a subway station. She looked extensively at the menu pages but the places which were the fit have bad reviews.  She was looking for American food (pizza included), preferably with a kids menu, no white tablecloth types or ethnic cuisine, under $20-25 a person. Shake Shack near the museum could be an option. Nywhiz thought that Mrs Popeye plan was totally unrealistic because the tour to SOL/Ellis Island would be 4-5 hours long and exhausting so best bet was to eat at Ellis island or near Battery Park. Gigino&#8217;s Wagner Park was an Italian restaurant with views of the Statue. She was suggested to change the plan. Inatteso on West Street was an upscale pizza place and owned by the same people as Adrienne&#8217;s on Stone Street that always gets good grades. Zetuna could be a good fit but does not include pizza. Irish Hunger Memorial was also close to Battery Park. P.J.

Big Nick&#8217;s Pizza and Burgers for folks with kids on B&#8217;way near 77th street could be a good place. Another good place for kids and adults was Vynl.</Summary_1>

      <Owner>     Yep, perhaps I wrongly assumed (a) since you hadn't said you'd be OK sharing a bed, that you wanted a room with 2 beds [booking a 2-bed room does kick up kick up the price tag], and (b) that you wanted to pay no more than $200/night with taxes/government-mandated surcharges. Those add just about 15% to the cost of a room, so to stay at or under $200/night total, you'd have to get a room for less than $174/night.        </Owner>

      <Owner>     I'm not shocked. At one time, it was one of my favorite restaurants, but not in recent years: the fare was too erratic in quality, and much as I love a historic  quot;old time quot; setting, we concluded that you could no longer count on dining there to be a pleasure.    I'm earnestly hoping, however, that it's not lost to us forever.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Didn't Town close some time ago? It was a tremendously popular expense-account spot for the neighborhood, and when seemingly everyone working in that area got laid off, they lost their clientele.     As for The John Dory- too bad, so sad. For a restaurant that put on such an obnoxious show of exclusivity initially, the whining about lack of foot traffic on 10th Avenue rings hollow. Del Posto, which is right next door, seems to be doing just fine.     My money is on the idea that we've all seen the last of The John Dory.    </Owner>

They use high-pressure sales tactics (such as showing you one dress that works for you and then a bunch of stuff that makes it look good in comparison) and  quot;play favorites quot; with discounts. However, if someone has seen a picture of a dress that they really like and Kleinfeld's has the  quot;exclusive quot;, I guess someone wouldn't be left with much choice but to go there to try it on.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     HI, NERJA -- think you'll be happier with R amp;K Bridal than at the Bridal Building. Much more  quot;off the rack quot; inventory, in a variety of sizes, so a greater possibility of being able to take a dress home with you, not just place an order.     And the sales assistants at R amp;K Bridal are much more helpful than at Kleinfeld's, where the majority of the staff is both indifferent to the customer and very  quot;pushy quot; to make a sale. Every bridal shop sales assistant gets a commission based on her sales totals, but nowhere is that more obvious than at Kleinfeld's. Blech.    You might also want to check out The Bridal Garden, an upscale bridal  quot;thrift shop quot;. Dresses are donated by designers  amp; shops, the proceeds benefit the nonprofit Sheltering Arms Children's Services.   http://www.bridalgarden.org    Wherever you go, it's best to make an appointment for a weekday morning -- avoid going on a Saturday or Sunday.   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>Wedding Stores The thread is about a bridal store and a place bit like a supermarket of wedding dresses. Bridal building, RK Bridals, Kleinfeld and Davids Bridal are the suggested bridal stores. Kleinfeld are in worldwide press and can be the best place to shop. In terms of pricing Kleinfeld can be expensive. David bride and bridal building have good price online. Klienfield have better marketing schemes and its TV show 'say yes to the dress' is popular. From the Klienfield show it looks like it is getting kind of publicity which steers any savvy shopper away. They use high-pressure sales tactics and play favorites with discounts. R &amp; K Bridal is better than Bridal Building as it much more 'off the rack' inventories in a variety of sizes, so a greater possibility of being able to take a dress home with you not just place an order. Sales assistants are much more helpful compare to Kleinfeld and are not very 'pushy' to make a sale Bridal Garden is upscale bridal 'thrift shop'. Dresses are donated by designers and shops and proceeds benefit the nonprofit sheltering arms children services.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person is looking for a bridal store in New York that's like a supermarket of wedding dresses. Many people recommended Kleinfield. Other recommendations were Bridal Building, RK Bridals, and David's Bridal, Bridal Garden. One person pointed out that the original poster will be happier with RK Bridal than at the Bridal Building and that the sales assistants at RK Bridal are much more helpful than at Kleinfeld.</Summary_2>

      <Owner>     Now Tannie ..... you do realize that the weekend you're talking about is Labor Day weekend? A lot of locals are out of town for the last long weekend of summer (btw ..... it's supposed to be nice weather) and school starts like on Tuesday? I would hazard to guess that most places will be fairly deserted except for tourist. The subway this morning was so empty it looked just like New Jersey.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVAOrWUcrM   </Owner>

      <Owner>     unlike some people I dont reply to posts when I dont know the answer. Why I can explain to Tannie why clubs here are not like LA and Las Vegas, I wouldnt begin to suggest where what I'm guessing a 20something year old should go. And, the 20somethings I know would kill me if I gave away their hot spots.    The most exclusive place in NYC right now is across the street from my office and neither Tannie, nor I would be getting in there anytime soon (all my Vanity Fair connections are in ad sales)    And, Bilmin - I was right about Eliot Spitzer too.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     There is a flight of steps to clamber up/down on the HOHO buses so that isn't ideal. How about simply using a City bus (1-day  quot;fun pass quot; Metrocard is just $8.25/person) -- and the free mini-bus shuttle service offered by the Downtown Alliance? Those buses are fully air-conditioned and you need to make only 1 step up/down.  www.downtownny.com/gettingaround/?sid=19  downtownny.com/images/&#8230;route_map.html   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Why on earth do you think the WTC and Chinatown are  quot;outer areas? quot; Do you think the thousands of people who worked in the WTC walked to work each day? They are both well served by subways. It's not like the subway only runs in midtown.    City buses will be easier on your husband's knees than HOHO buses - city buses  quot;kneel quot; and the newer ones have essentially no steps inside, just one small step from the curb onto the low bus floor.     And yes, the WTC and Chinatown are both well served by city bus routes as well.    </Owner>

We will be staying at the Affina Dumont, 150 E. 34th St.   Can someone give me guidance on where exactly E. 35 St. Marina is?   Also, do you know how long this ride will take?

      <Owner>     I rode the Water taxi. It went very smoothly and was a fun way to get to the US Open. It was a beautiful Sat morning. The subway was very crowded and took about the same amount of time. The water taxi was very relaxing and a fun way to see the skyline. There was no line to get on and the buses were ready to take us to the Open. The Powerade sponsors were there and they gave each of us a Powerade and we used this to refill with water at the open!    Have fun. Thanks for the great tip.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     $23.99 for watchmen in JR right now, with tax, that works out to be just over &#163;15, so still cheaper than the likes of play.com    sorry... tangent...     JR is my preferred choice for DVD's Blu Ray, Music etc etc nowadays. There is always a discount voucher around too, so $5 off if you spend $50, which can bring the price down a bit further..     with Blu Ray, be sure that it'll work on your own blu ray player at home, most discs are region free, some are not (and then would need a region free blu ray player)    same goes for dvd   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Curiously I was in J amp;R last thursday and they were selling it for $30 + tax which made it more than buying it from playusa.com, maybe the &#163;23.99 is the online price?    </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A girl needed information about the music store in NYC so that she could send her boyfriend there. During her last visit, she sent her boyfriend to the Virgin Megastore but since that store was closed she wanted to know about the other stores. The suggested stores were Blockbusters, J&amp;R, b&amp;h, Forbidden planet and Best Buy.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person asked she could send her boyfriend to buy music and dvd in New York. He used to go to Virgin Megastore, but it's closed. She asked if there's a Mega Best Buy on Manhattan. Many people recommended JR. One person pointed out that the original poster should check the price. Also one Best Buy that another person could think of is on 5th and 44th. An independent music shop in Lafayette was suggested too. Another commenter said that she doesn't like Best Buy, but she would sometimes go to Barnes and Noble and Border's Books.</Summary_2>

    <Title>travel from New York JFK International airport to Philadelp</Title>

    <Body>     Hi, is there any buses/ coach travel directly from New York JFK international airport to Philadelphia (e,g downtown)  thanks    </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Not that I know of, but you can get the AirTrain at JFK to the Long Island RailRoad, which will take you directly to Penn Station, from which you can take an Amtrak directly to Philadelphia. To save some money, you could instead take a New Jersey Transit train from Penn Station to Trenton, and from there get a SEPTA regional rail train (the R7 line) directly into Philadelphia. To save EVEN more money, instead of taking the LIRR from JFK to Penn Station, you could take the subway.     I know that probably sounds very confusing, but if you let us know your budget and the day and time you expect to arrive at JFK, I'll plot it all out for you and send you links to the schedules and fares.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Amtrak will be faster than the bus, but if you prefer a bus, Take either Bolt Bus or Mega Bus. Both will take you from Penn Station to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia. Both will take 2 hours (plus any additional traffic time). Megabus has seats available for your date now ($5). BoltBus doesn't have tickets available for that date yet, but when they do go on sale, they're likely to cost the same or less. The fares for both companies will get more expensive the closer you get to your date.     Amtrak will take you from Penn Station to 30th Street Station in under an hour and a half, but will cost more - the cheapest fare I see for your date right now is $34. That will also get more expensive as we get closer to your date.    </Owner>

    <Title>Someone point me to quot;TKTS Booth - 101quot;, please?</Title>
    <Owner>5inourfamily</Owner>
    <Body>     Have never bought show tickets this way and wondering if the experts would kindly point me to a easily navigable but complete site so that I can decide if this is the best way for us to go this year-- traveling in mid-December. Already have many great show suggestions both on and off Broadway. Just need to better understand how to get the better deals. . I.E. - While I'll continue to view discount ticket sites on line between now and December, I'm wondering if better deals are to be found at the TKTS booth? (we have a long list of titles that we'd enjoy; are all booth locations (only 2, right?) open 7 days a week? do they sell tickets for both afternoon and evening shows? etc. This is our fourth family trip and I would like to feel confident enough to give something like this a shot if it truly is the way to go. . .  thx!   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Here is their website with all their info, hours, etc.:    http://www.tdf.org/TDF_ServicePage.aspx?id=56    Other pointers:    * Sold out shows like Jersey Boys, Lion King and South Pacific are never (if ever) sold at TKTS booths. For those shows, use a website like www.broadwaybox.com .     Try to avoid using ticket brokers. They are rip-offs.    * You can see what was selling at the booths each previous week, from their website above.    * The lines at the South Street Seaport booth are shorter than Times Square, and the one in Downtown Brooklyn is even less crowded.    * If you have an idea of shows you want to see, print out their seating charts and bring them to the TKTS booth. The clerks will tell you general sections of what they have.    * If you can, sit separately. Tell the clerk. You might be able to get better seats sitting alone.    * Don't let the clerks or long lines behind you pressure you. Take your time.

    <Title>Travel from JFK on Boxing day....Train or Cab ???</Title>
    <Owner>ChristianKent</Owner>
    <Body>       Hi    I will be travelling from the UK to NY on 26th December, boxing day. In the UK the train service pretty much shuts down and the cabs are double time as its a bank holiday.    In NY do trains/subway run on boxing day, also are cabs double time or the same $60 from JFK. Think thats what I paid earlier in the year.   Also im travelling back on new years day, are the trains/subway running to JFK and are cabs double times ?    Thanks very much for your help  Christian   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     We don't have Boxing Day here so you'll have no problem with train service or cabs. On holidays, such as New Year's Day, the trains run on holiday schedules (not sure what you mean by double times?), which are less frequent but still regular. What train are you planning to take? The AirTrain/subway? I don't think that'd cause much of a problem - leave a little extra time but not a big deal.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Cabs in NYC do not charge extra on holidays; they charge the same fare that they charge on other days.  quot;Boxing Day quot; is not any kind of holiday at all in the US; no one here observes it, and most people born here have never even heard of it. If you ask about  quot;boxing day quot; hours or  quot;boxing day quot; closures, all you can expect is a puzzled look. (The same, by the way, is true for  quot;Easter Monday quot;, and we also do not use the term  quot;bank holiday quot; here either.)   </Owner>

    <Body>     Hi All:    I'm thinking of surprising my boyfriend with a 3 night stay in NYC for his 30th. However, his birthday is in December (before Christmas). I've found some quite affordable rates and I'm wondering what's the consensus on NYC in December? Weather-wise - is it unbearable?? Do I need to pack like we're going to the snow? LOL    Any advice is appreciated,    Alanna   </Body>

      <Owner>     I've been able to bear with the December weather since I was born. Between global warming and being situated near the ocean, New York does seem to get less snow than either north or west of the city.    The weather does tend to be cold, but not bone chillingly so. I'd take a decent jacket as well as a sweater. Having a hat, gloves, a scarf and good shoes also helps. One does not wear sandals in December.    If it does snow, the City is absolutely beautiful. There is no issue with transporation as we travel underground. Also, the city does a good job of clearing the streets and the sidewalks.    BTW, December is a busy time before x-mas, and many hotels do have high rates for this period of time. After the summer, this is the busiest season for touring.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     We visited the city in the first week of January several years ago. My suggestion would be to pack so as to dress in layers. That way, you can add layers of clothing for warmth or dress lighter depending on how you find the temperature.    We're from the deep south and NYC experienced record lows while we were there along with drizzling rain. We were fine though with coats, boots, and a small umbrella. It's a very festive time of year in the city and we loved it.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     NYC in December is great and the city is beautiful. Last year, it was cold but sunny most of December and began snowing a few days before we left. The cold isn't bad if you bring the right clothes. There were people on the street complaining about the cold who were wearing blue jeans, sneakers, and a jacket.    Bring a coat that reaches your knees, a good hat  amp; gloves, maybe a wool cardigan and slacks, leather shoes that cover your foot - and can walk in. =)   </Owner>

Others said that its a nice weather and the city is beautiful during december and suggested to keep warm clothes.  Finally, the person booked the tickets to NYC.</Summary_1>

    <Title>Murray Hill Inn</Title>
    <Owner>mlschless</Owner>
    <Body>     I've read the reviews on TA and they seem good, but wanted to check in here and see if anyone has stayed there recently and/or has an opinion.    My son lives in Murray Hill so I was drawn to it by location. I don't need fancy as I don't spend much time in the hotel and I prefer to spend my money on shows and entertainment. I do want clean though, and friendly helpful staff is always nice too.    I believe there's another hotel in NYC with a similar name, so to avoid any confusion, this is the hotel I'm referring to. http://www.murrayhillinn.com/    Thanks!   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     It's an illegal hotel meant for impoverished New Yorkers.     I'm sure someone else can suggest a better option. What are your dates and budget per night?    </Owner>

      <Owner>     There are LOADS of good options in Murray Hill without resorting to an illegal hotel.    Murray Hill East Suites  Eastgate Tower  Shelburne Murray Hill  Affinia Dumont    You can sometimes find good deals for the Kitano, a very nice hotel on Park Ave.  amp; 38th st.    But what I would do in your place (assuming it's not a 2 week stay) is book something cancelable that you could live with and try bidding on Priceline for a 4* hotel in Empire STate area. If you get a win, it will either be 70 Park or the Morgan, both very nice boutique hotels.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Really? Illegal? Why do you say that? The website looks legit and there are tons of reviews here on TA. How is one to know if a hotel is illegal? What should one be looking for?    As to budget, I'm looking to spend $1000 total for air and hotel. My airfare is $419 so that leaves me roughly $600 for hotel. I'm not sure but I believe the NYC hotel tax is around 15%, so that would put my base rate for the hotel (pre-tax) at around $510 total or an average of no more than $170/night for three nights).   </Owner>

      <Owner>     You can figure out whether a hotel is legal or not by looking at the zoning. Generally, anything in an apartment building is an illegal hotel, and if the price sounds too good to be true, it's probably an illegal hotel.     The business having a website is no indicator of its credibility. Anyone who disagrees might want to look into the purchase of a bonsai kitten:     http://www.shorty.com/bonsaikitten   </Owner>

      <Owner>     A taxi is not a good idea as you're going from NYC to NJ and rates get crazy with taxis allowed to charge basically whatever they want. For public transportation, you'll walk or take a subway or bus down to Penn station in NYC (33rd st.  amp; 7th ave.) and from there   http://www.giants.com/parkingauthority.asp    It will cost $10-14/person roundtrip from what I gather.    You might want to look into a car service like  dial7.com  to see what it would cost.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     There is a bus that runs directly to Giants Stadium from the Port Authroity bus terminal for events, and Port Authority is just a little bit west of Times Square. It's easily walkable. The buses get their own lanes back after the concert, so the trip back is much much faster than taking a regular car/taxi. Yuo do NOT want to be taking a taxi in either direction, but especially back from that concert.     Also, I have to add, please don't limit yourself to staying in the Times Square area. Most of us feel that it's really not the best place to stay.    </Owner>

    <Title>Is this timeline do-able?</Title>
    <Owner>Derbyangel</Owner>
    <Body>     Hi everybody, I'm coming to town October 10 with my 15 year old daughter. We arrive at 2 and have tickets for Mama Mia at 8. (I know, I know--I probably shouldn't have gotten for day of arrival but I got a really great deal through my husbands work) Do the experts here think we could go to the Marriott Marquis Lounge and have the cheese and dessert buffet before the show? I know the food may not be ideal but she would enjoy the view and feel very grown up. We can leave shortly after checking into our mid-town hotel and already know how to use the subway. Is this possible or is my timeline totally unrealistic? Thanks to everybody here for being such a great resource.   DA    </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     You don't say which airport you're coming from, so I am generalising a bit here..     It should take no more than 90 minutes to get from either JFK or EWR to your hotel. (I'm unsure if you're staying at the Marriot Marquis, as you just say  quot;midtown hotel quot; or just going for a buffet!!).    Anyway, 2pm - 3.45pm to get to hotel, give yourself an hour and a quarter to get freshened up, changed, and relax which makes it now 5pm.     So, IMO, you've actually got 3 hours before the tickets at 8pm, (give or take half an hour, as you'll probably have to get their earlier.     As I said, these are huge generalisations, as I'm unsure what airport, and what transportation options you're taking, and also where you're actually staying.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Please tell me that you got your tickets on broadway box and did not pay full price for them... I would wait till after the show or another day to go to the Marriott Marquis if you think your daughter will like it. Just grab something lite before the show either near the theater or near your hotel. You don't want to have to rush out of the lounge if your daughter is really into it.. Ps at 15 I bet she already feels very grown up just ask her..    You will have no problem with your timetable unless there are major weather delays on your flight. So if on time just relax and take it easy.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     HI, DERBY -- the walk from the Benjamin to the Marriott Marquis shouldn't take you more than 20 minutes, although you may decide to stop to ogle St. Patrick's Cathedral and/or Rockefeller Center en route; the Winter Garden Theatre is just 4-1/2 blocks from the Marquis.     So barring horrific delay at LGA, you should be fine. The buffet at the Marriott isn't so expansive or fabulous that you'll need anywhere close to 2 hours to do it justice :-)   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Hi cailin,  As I don't know what kind of things you like to do, can't really advise you too much. Museums, park, Empire State, Top of the Rock, bridges... Maybe read the sections to the side of this page on things to do, and the FAQs to get ideas to get you started. As you mentioned shopping, I wouldn't bother going to Jersey Gardens, there are usually good sales in the city in much more pleasant surroundings. But that's just me! However, I do believe that Woodbury Common has more stores than Jersey Gardens. If you use the search box just above this thread, you will get more info. The search box is your friend, no matter what you might be able to think of asking, you will find previous threads on the topic.  Most definitely, use the subway for your travelling around the city. Buy a 7 day ticket, about $27 dollars, can be used on buses ans subways and is the best value item you will buy!      </Owner>

    <Title>Help finding hotel over christmas - Brooklyn V Manhattan</Title>
    <Owner>ollybee</Owner>
    <Body>     Hi,    My girlfriend and I are hoping to go to NY over christmas (24th - 29th Dec) and could do with some help finding a hotel. We're on a fairly tight budget (but who isnt?!) and would like a fairly nice (i.e clean, not too shabby!) double room with private bathroom for under $250 inc tax. Any suggestions?    We've been quoted a price of $213 a night (inc tax) for the Hotel Le Bleu in Brooklyn - it looks great, but do you think the area is ok? We're both 25 and like eating out, art, alternative music but arent into clubbing.    I've been to NY twice before, but never been to Brooklyn. Would it be a hassle getting the subway to Manhattan every day? I already commute in London, so would rather walk places than be on a train.     Also open to staying in a B amp;B as I stayed at the Ivy Terrace last time and loved it.    Any suggestions would be welcome! :)   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Hi there    My fiance and I are in NY from 26th-30th December and I've just booked our hotel through www.travelrepublic.co.uk - the hotel we are staying at has really good reviews on trip advisor (I checked before I booked!) and is costing &#163;87.50 a night.     The list of hotels available will come up in price order (lowest first) so you'll see a lot of hostels to start with but just keep scrolling through until a decent hotel comes up.     Although Midtown isn't my preferred place to stay in NY for that price I had to book it!   We are staying at the Wyndham Garden Midtown Convention Center and Hotel.    You should also get the option to pay a small deposit now and the remainder to paid in next month.     I used this website earlier in the year to book a hotel for a holiday in Spain and it worked out fine and I'm going to another part of Spain next week and have used them again so hopefully everything will go as smoothly!     If you want to stay in Brooklyn the Marriott was coming up at a good price on the website.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I see lots of options within your budget in Manhattan on quikbook.com that are fully cancelable and require no prepayment. The Smyth Tribeca is trendy and in a cool downtown location. The Hotel on Rivington on the lower east side is another option.    If you want 2 beds, the Hampton Inn Chelsea has a room with 2 queens (and I believe they include free cont/ b/f) for $169/night plus tax (~15%)    </Owner>

      <Owner>     I live a couple of blocks from the Hotel Le Bleu and can provide some information:    The Hotel: The hotel is new and modern with some strange touches, like the bathroom viewed from the room. It has a rooftop bar that just opened as well as a restaurant. Check out the reviews and photos on TA. The hotel is located on a less than scenic area of 4th Ave in Bklyn. To one side is a cab garage and to the other side is a nephrology center. The area is not exactly scenic, but is in no way dangerous. It is also right near the historic Old Stone House.     The Area: One Block. That is, just walk up one block from 4th Avenue and you are in the heart of Park Slope. The area is filled with elegant brownstones and great architecture.     Fifth Avenue has become a wonderland of food and drink. The Gate, my favorite bar is on 5th and 3rd Street. Restaurant choices include Thai [Song and Long Tan], French [Moutard and Belleville], Italian [La Villa], Vegetarian [Snice], Mexican [Rachels], Peruvian Chicken [Coco Roco], Turkish [I forgot the name], and others. And that's just on the surrounding blocks. There are too many choices to name them all. Fifth Avenue is also noted for its boutiques.    Crossing Residential 6th Avenue to Seventh Avenue is another long retail strip. This is a more established shopping street than 5th Avenue and has somewhat more established stores.     You are also five avenues away from Prospect Park [a 15 minute walk]. Prospect Park is amazing. Also right there are the Brooklyn Museum, the Farmers Market [Saturday at Grand Army Plaza], the Botanic Gardens and BAM. BAM has great performances and houses an art cinema as well.    Transportation to Manhattan is a snap. Just hop on the R train at Union and 4th and you're 20 minutes away. Want to go to Williamsburg, its a short ride on the nearby G train.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thanks for all your help! We've changed dates now to suit cheap flights, so no more christmas for us (sob) - but we're going from 7 - 12 Nov (my birthday!).     We've tentatively booked the Comfort Inn Manhattan Bridge for $855 inc tax, which seems like a pretty good deal... Not posh, but good location and a decent price as our budget is actually more like $200 inc tax. Oh, confusion!    Thanks for all the help anyway - will definitely be hanging out in Brooklyn while we're there.    </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A person was hoping to go to NY over christmas with his girlfriend and needed help for finding a hotel. He was willing to spend about $250 for a double room with private bathroom. He needed suggestions whether to find hotel in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Most people recommended him to stay in Manhattan as there were many hotels. Many restaurants were there.  The person finally booked the Comfort Inn Manhattan Bridge. It was in a good location with a decent price.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person is looking for a hotel that's clean with double room and private bathroom for under $250 including tax over Christmas (24th - 29th December). He also wants to know if the area around Hotel Le Bleu in Brooklyn is okay because he's been quoted $213 a night (including tax). He also wanted to know if it'll be a hassle getting the subway to Manhattan every day. Someone recommended checking the Travel Republic website for booking hotels. She said that she's staying at the Wyndham Garden Midtown Convention Center and Hotel for 87.50 pounds a night. Another person said shaw saw a lot of options within the budget in Manhattan on quikbook.com like The Smyth Tribeca (trendy and in a cool downtown location), The Hotel on Rivington (lower east side), and the Hampton Inn Chelsea (2 queens in a room for $169/night plus tax (about 15%)). Someone who lives a couple of blocks from Hotel Le Bleu said that the hotel is new and modern. She said that the area i not scenic, but it is not dangerous. It is near places to eat and drink. In terms of transportation to Manhattan, it is a snap. Just hop on the R train at Union and 4th and it'll take 20 minutes to get to Manhattan.</Summary_2>

    <Title>When/how to buy tickets</Title>
    <Owner>Aug2009</Owner>
    <Body>     Hi!    We are visiting NYC from 17th to 23rd December. I've already booked the flights and hotel and I've been looking at what to do when we are there.    I'm in the process of putting together an itinerary at the moment and would like some help with regards to buying tickets.    For the following attractions would it be advisable/cheaper to book tickets in advance and if so from where;  1) Knicks tickets for either 18th/20th/22nd December.  2) Ice skating on 19th/20th/21st December at the Wollman rink.  3) Top of the Rock  4) Radio City Xmas Spectacular    Thanks so much for any help.    Jon   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     You can't book ice skating in advance. Just pay when you go.  Top of the Rock can be bought in advance but it's not really necessary. Lines are usually not long. You can either buy Radio City tix in advance OR take your chances for same day tix at one of the TKTS booths. Info on the booths at  tdf.org/tkts   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thanks for the swift reply,    Is it usually easy to buy tickets for the skating or is it very busy that time of year?    I've heard TOTR do a downloadable MP3 guide if you buy tickets online, can you still download this from anywhere if you buy on the day? Also is there anywhere that sells discount tickets online for TOTR?    As for the basketball, I've signed up to be a Knicks insider so I'm assuming thats the best place to buy (what concerns me is Stubhub and Ticketmaster are both selling tickets for the games now yet the official Knicks website says that tickets will go on sale soon).    Thanks all   </Owner>

      <Owner>     It may be crowded at the ice rink but it's much bigger than at Rockefeller Center so you shouldn't have a problem. Can't answer about the mp3 guide. The problem with buying TOTR tix online in advance is you have to specific a date and time and that doesn't allow for weather issues.    I don't know much about basketball tickets but I do know the season tickets go out much before the single tickets. What you're seeing on stubhub and wherever else is probably people with season tix who are selling off individual games they don't want. If you see a price on stubhub that you like, there's no reason not to buy them there as far as I know.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Those two agencies Stubhub and Ticketmaster have been known to sell tickets in anticipation of delivery before the event... If you can get them from Ticketmaster I would go for it because there is no reason to wait if you are not getting them at a discount.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     TOTR will now refund (online) the purchase price of tickets bought online if you make that request at least 24 hours before the date  amp; time shown in your ticket. On shorter notice, they will exchange-- at the Will Call desk [somewhat shorter hours than the Box Office] -- tickets purchased online for another date/time.    TOTR has dropped the price for online tickets on its website to $18/adult, the same price as what you get with most discount coupons. The only better one is the $3 Theatermania coupon, but even it doesn't give a discount for child or senior tix as TOTR's web site does.  www.theatermania.com/extras/TopOfTheRock/    That MOMA/TOTR nywhiz flagged is a great deal!   </Owner>

Someone replied that the ice rink at Rockefeller Center was much bigger so in the crowded time getting ticket would not be a problem.

    <Title>Taxis from Newary Airport</Title>
    <Owner>MissOtter</Owner>
    <Body>     Hi  Think I'm going to splash out and get a taxi from the airport to the Hotel as I think it'll be quicker and easier after a long flight just to find a cab  amp; go (The hotel is near Penn Station but we REALLY do NOT want to get the train) I think the fare will be about $45 plus toll  amp; tips.   Can anyone tell me what the toll is, and also looking at the map, would the taxi take us all the way in  amp; over the bridge on route 78, also how long the drive takes in mid-afternoon traffic on a Monday? Trying to get an idea of what we'll see on the way in.     Aswell, the taxis at Newark airport, are they the yellow cabs like the ones in NY or are they different as the airport is not in NYC?  Thanks    ps. my thoughts are with everyone in NY on this day of remembrance.   </Body>

      <Owner>     LMV is right you should contact dial 7 and arrange for a car service (not inside pick up) it will be about the same or maybe even a little cheaper. The total should be about $60 with fee, tolls and tip.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     From Newark airport (airport code EWR) a car service, like carmel, dial7 or allstate, will be more convient and probibally lower cost than a taxi. NYC taxi cabs do not pick up at EWR, so you would get a nj taxi from the dispatcher. They will ask you the area you are going to and hand you a slip of paper with the BASE fare, add tolls (around $10) and a tip. To penn station the base fare will be around $55-60, so the total cost around $75-80. A car service will save you around $10, have a nicer car (usually) and meet you outside. DO NOT ask for inside pickup as then you will pay for parking and wait time. Prebook the car service, they will give you instructions on how to meet the car, but basically, you call when you get your luggage (if from overseas, when you clear customs and immigration) and they will meet you outside. eazy-peazy (did i spell that correctly?)   </Owner>

    <Title>Room Mate Grace VS Night Hotel</Title>
    <Owner>Bianks</Owner>
    <Body>     I think I may have just answered my own question - I like the looks of Room Mate Grace a little more than Night Hotel.  But before I take the plunge and book, would anyone here vote for 1 over the other?  Also, never been to NYC before. I hope this will be close enough to all the action???      (I had some others on the list too. On the Ave, Hilton Garden Inn, Best Western Bowery, Crowne Plaza, Rockerfeller... )   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Oh, I forgot to add, stay is for 8 nights, end of April, therefore could I expect prices to drop further at those 2 places or is it recommended that I just book now?   </Owner>

      <Owner>     They're both trendy boutique hotels moderately priced with very compact rooms. RM Grace has the lobby bar which evidently can get loud and raucous on weekends. You don't say how many you are, how long you're visiting or when, but it's typical here to book without prepaying and make a cancelable reservation should rates drop nearer your trip. Neither of these would be my choice b/c rooms are just too small and claustrophic but our tastes/priorities are obviously different.    As for being near the  quot;action quot; it depends on what action you mean. Most first time tourists think of Times Square as the center of the action and it really isn't except for tourists and theater. The Best Western Hanbee, for example, would be closer to the young trendy areas of the city where locals would go.   </Owner>

The reason I was thinking of booking so soon is that I'm from Australia and the exchange rate for us is very strong at the moment so I didn't want to miss the boat.  I would usually book through expedia.com.au who offer a $30 cancellation fee (in which case I would book, then cancel should something better come up, then re-book elsewhere etc), however both hotels are not listed on there yet. Also Room Mate Grace have a non-refundable which is significantly cheaper than the refundable option.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     At this point for that time of year I would go with the refundable option since there very well could be sales at even those hotels. I faced a similar decision on a recent trip to Italy and I booked the refundable which was 30 euro more per night but by the time I ended up booking I got the same room for 50 euro less and they threw in a dinner for two and some other things. Refundable this far in advance is always the best option. Non Refundable is always the best option when you are close to your date and there is absolutely no chance that you will change your dates or your hotel.   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A person was planning to stay in the New York City for 8 nights. He needed suggestions for making a choice between Room Mate Grace and Night Hotel. He had some other options like Hilton Garden Inn, Best Western Bowery, Crowne Plaza and Rockerfeller. He also wanted opinion about refundable and non refundable booking option. Someone suggested that Best Western Hanbee can be right choice as it would be closer to the young trendy areas of the city. He was also suggested to go with the refundable booking option since in April hotels would have good sales.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person was deciding between Room Mate Grace and Night Hotel, and was looking for opinion from others. She will be staying for 8 nights at the end of April, and wanted to know if she should book now or wait for prices to drop later.  Someone mentioned that she thinks both hotels are moderately priced and trendy, but do not like the fact they're small. One person recommended the Best Western Hanbee instead. Another person recommended to go with the refundable option because prices could decrease later, citing her own experience in Italy.</Summary_2>

    <Title>Trip Report at last !!...Part 2</Title>
    <Owner>chrissy420</Owner>
    <Body>     Forgotten how NY has the WOW... just amazing..Sunday we decided to do some walking..Stepped out and walk to Greenwich Village, just left the hotel and tuned into 42nd street when my hubby heard and spotted a large Harley Davidson Rideout escorted by Police Bikes and Fire Engines..I think this made his day, took some really nice photos.Walked around the Village, then decided to walk back towards Chelsea Markets,found ourselves by the river, sat a while and watched all the runners and skaters and New Yorkers enjoying their leisure time with their families, thought we would walk the HighLine, we thought this are was really nice, what a great idea. Chelsea markets made a great stopping place for lunch, lots of choice and a welcome break from the sun..Refreshed again more walking,back to our Hotel, our feet were ready to drop off but we had seen loads of interesting things, really nice areas (and some not so great ones)...Time to have a drink and freshen up before venturing out again to The Rock., hadnt planned to go up, but we were there just before sunset so it sort of just happened, and wow so glad we did..it was amazing...   </Body>

      <Owner>     Oh wow, I can't wait to experience the TOTR at sunset in December. For now, I can only imagine...    bb   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Chelsea markets is an area of specialist food shops and serve your self cafes.. We had soup and sandwiches, but there was the usual pitza slices, Italian sandwiches, wraps etc..and a faboulous fish market that had yummy lobster for sale for lunch, as well as other seafood to eat as you go..There is also a really nice bakery that bakes the bread on site... All nice lunch stuff, but no fancy restuarants or even waiter service,but nice food and a good atmosphere to sit and watch the world go by.Almost forgot..fab. cup cakes yummy.. Enjoy.. We really enjoyed our walk on the high line, and accessable just by chelsea markets. Have a great trip.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thank you Chrissy for highlighting the High Line,I hadnt heard of this before so looked it up and it looks great. We are going in November for daughters 18th and i have added this to our itinerary. Although I have to be honest and say that the cupcakes was all i needed to hear!!    I have found a map of the high line. Am i right in thinking that if you get tired (i have arthritis so cant walk for hours) you can get off part way through the walk and how long would it take to walk the whole thing as i could meet everyone at the end if they want to do the full walk.    thanks again  sharron   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Glad to hear you liked the sound of the highline, we enjoyed it, mainly because it was such a contrast in a busy city...You can get off at various places along the way, although im not sure exactly where.. Its not completed yet so the walk isnt that long, but maybe since August a little more is finished.. There is disabled access at some places, y0u may need to track those down because there are quite a few steps to enter, but there is an elevator at 14th street. How nice to celebrating your daughters 18th in NY enjoy your time together...   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Hi Queens,     Yes, I have read some of the reviews but I guess I was in denial. Thanks for keeping it real for me. We have all heard so many good things about TOTG from family that has visited in the past, but it was probably during those  quot;good ole days quot;.    I definitely will reecommend to my friends that we do drinks and take some snapshots, so we can put a check by TOTG on our  quot;must do quot; list and move on to better things.    We will be going to see Wicked on Thurs, Dec 17th, and instead of Sunday brunch on TOTG, I think we should focus on pre or post dinner plans for Thursday night. A level above casual dining, but it doesn't have to be the finest of dining, anything but French, and around $50 pp not including drinks. A prix fixe menu would be good! And somewhere that locals frequent...    Thanks for your help!    bb    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Babe-- make sure you take your pictures early. The last day of their license is 12-31-09 which means you will be there in the last week of their operation and given the acrimonious way they have been thrown out of the park I would not expect any kind of service from there.... There are so many other places in the city deserving of your time and attention do not waste a minute on this place.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I hate to be the one to say this, but I think that the old girl needs a facelift. The potential for elegance is great, but 1) the menu needs an update and 2) the decor isn't competing the way it should with the very modern designs found in other chi-chi places. Its location has no parallel, but it isn't keeping up with the Joneses.   </Owner>

I'm looking for accommodation in chelsea/east village/gramercy park - mainly because i like the sound of these areas. Our budget is no more than 250 usd a night. I'd appreciate any suggestions gt; i know that at this price i can't be too picky - but i like light, clean, modern finishings, and maybe even a view?! Okay, i may be asking too much :). In the meantime, i'll keep scouring the posts. E   </Body>

      <Owner>     Are you arriving here in just a few weeks or are you planning for October 2010? If you'll be here shortly, please give us the dates of your anticipated stay.     Fair warning: hotel rates are high in the fall here, and you literally can't afford to be picky at this point, assuming you intend to arrive soon. So be prepared to be flexible :-)   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Hey everyone.      We are flying in 9 October and flying out 21 October.       Reading through the other posts i have looked at Affinia Shelbourne, affinia Dumont, Gem Chelsea, Hotel 79.      If there are hotels in other areas that you may think meet my criteria, we're flexible.      Cheers,      E      </Owner>

      <Owner>     I loved the Affinia Dumont.    Its a block from the subway stop that will get you anywhere (via connections )to anywhere you want to go in NYC.  Rooms are super clean and the kitchens are super handy.There is a drug store and a Deli with awsome salads close by.    The lobby smells like fresh cut flowers.  Its not so much modern furnishings but the view...  If you look at their Trip Advisor thing i posted a picture from my window.  I want to go back.......   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Since you'll be here for almost 2 weeks (12 nights, not 10, am I right?), think you would be best served by an apartment-style/suites hotel with kitchenette facilities and a bit more space.     Living out of a suitcase for 12 nights in a room the size of most NYC hotels wouldn't be fun (and the GEM rooms are tighter quarters than many). Plus, having a kitchenette means you won't have to go out all the time for every meal, and drinks. So it actually can save you money.    Any of the Affinia properties would be fine, but they're almost all beyond your budget for those dates. The Eastgate Tower, an Affinia property, is within your price range via Quikbook; its decor, however, may be too dated for you.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     I think you have to forget about picking an area and find a hotel that will suit you at that budget for those dates. It's a bit late to be booking such a long stay. The Empire Hotel is modern and trendy and running a special on   travelzoo.com  for $239/night plus tax. That will buy a standard queen room which is not terribly large but it's a good location. Reviews on the hotel are mixed. Keep in mind taxes will add ~ 15% to that price to bring it to $275.    You might want to consider splitting your stay between 2 hotels in 2 different areas which may give you more options since a lot of hotels aren't available for your whole stay. The Hampton Inn Seaport while not terribly central is a good hotel that's relatively modern, has some views and includes a free continental breakfast. It's ~$200-220/night plus tax depending on what room you pick and whether you prepay. You could also consider staying just outside Manhattan a train ride away. The Westin Jersey City and the W Hoboken are both new and very modern offering some views.    </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A place to stay for 250usd The thread is about finding accommodation in areas of New York like chelsea/east village/gramercy park in the budget of 250 usd. Hotel rates are high in New York during October. Out of several hotels, Affinia Dumont is a good option as it is closer to subway stop ,have super clean rooms and super handy kitchens which will help to save money.If the hotel location is made flexible there can be other hotels like The Empire Hotel and Hampton Inn Seaport which have rate below 250 usd.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person is looking for accommodation in Chelsea/East Village/Gramercy Park for no more than $250 a night between October 9 and 21. She wanted the palce light, clean, and with modern finishings and perhaps a view. Someone suggested that The Eastgate Tower, is within her price range via Quikbook, but not so modern. One person mentioned that she likes the Affinia Dumont, but it's not that modern as well. Other recommendations are the Empire Hotel, The Hampton Inn Seaport, The Westin Jersey City, and the W Hoboken.</Summary_2>

    <Title>Continental passengers - $59 helicopter between EWR amp; NYC</Title>
    <Owner>CockleCove</Owner>
    <Body>     Special deal for Continental Airline passengers arriving at/departing from Newark Liberty International Airport from now until October 30. Instead of bus, train or cab, you can use US Helicopter's service to get from or to EWR for just $59. More info here:  continental.com/web/&#8230;    </Body>

      <Owner>     It wouldn't let me in properly to see the details. I am assuming that price is per passenger?! Still a good price for a helicopter flight though given the wonderful views you would get.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I saw the same offer on the Continental newsletter today too, and it caught my eye. As long as one can afford it, and fancied a view of NYC from up above, it sounds great! It's all about the experience! Mind you, when you look at the nitty gritty, it adds up to qute a bit more, but probably still under $100. Excerpt from website:    * The promotional fare does not include passenger facility charges of up to $18 per segment, Sept. 11th security fee of up to $5 each way, Federal segment tax of $3.60 per segment or 7.5% U.S. Transportation Tax.    I think if I was flying into Newark soon, I'd definitely think about it, but maybe I'd be a bit afraid!   Think it's valid until January.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I've reprinted below the e-mail I received. I now see that the Federal government considers the helicopter ride to be a  quot;flight quot; so there are a bunch of mandatory surcharges :-(    The helicopter service is obviously targeted to the well-heeled or those on an expense account. But it's still cheaper than the helicopter sightseeing tours of the same length, and I know some tourists are keenly interested in those.     Note that you can fly into downtown Manhattan (near the South Street Seaport) or midtown east.    **********************  To take advantage of this special offer, choose one of the following as your origin or destination when booking your Continental flight.     * For travel to and from Downtown Manhattan Heliport, enter destination code  quot;JRB. quot;   * For travel to and from East 34th Street Heliport, enter destination code  quot;TSS. quot;    If you have not yet purchased your ticket with Continental Airlines, book now.  Terms and Conditions    Promotion valid for tickets purchased between Aug. 10 and Oct. 30, 2009, on US Helicopter codeshare flights to/from the Manhattan midtown (TSS) or the downtown (JRB) heliports when connecting to/from a Continental flight at Newark Liberty Airport (EWR).    Travel must be complete by Jan. 15, 2010.    * The promotional fare does not include passenger facility charges of up to $18 per segment, Sept. 11th security fee of up to $5 each way, Federal segment tax of $3.60 per segment or 7.5% U.S. Transportation Tax.    **Flights booked as codeshare flights will automatically receive mileage. For customers who book directly with US Helicopter, both the Continental boarding pass and Helicopter receipt for the promotional fare will need to be sent to OnePass to receive mileage for the Helicopter segment.    For customers who have already purchased their tickets with Continental Airlines and would like to add US Helicopter, please contact a Continental representative at 800-525-0280, or you can purchase directly from US Helicopter at Newark Liberty at gate C-71 or at the heliports. Please provide the US Helicopter representative with your Continental boarding pass.   </Owner>

    <Body>     Hi 3 of my friends and I are going to NYC on Dec 19-21 or the 22. Our ages range from 21-25. We would like to find a budget friendly hotel around 200-250 a night. We want it to be clean and in a good location but doesnt have to be high end because we will only be sleeping in it. Any suggestions? thanks!   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Three in a room for $200/250 at that time of year is going to be a challenge....you know that, right?  Have you looked to your left on this forum - like I'm doing right now and seeing a listing for Discount Hotels - give that a shot - or try one of my regular places The Hotel Stanford on 32nd Street - they have rooms that will not break the bank - not sure about that time of year though, everyone jacks up the prices....   </Owner>

      <Owner>     On your dates, quikbook.com is showing a rate of $199 for 4 with a room with 2 queen beds. I would grab this ASAP as that's an excellent rate for that time and you'll be hard pressed to find something better. Rooms with 2 queen beds aren't all that common. That rate won't last long either. With quikbook, rates are usually fully cancelable up until one or two days before arrival. This hotel is located at South Street Seaport, nearly all the way downtown.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     As I read it it's 4 to the room and those dates are a good time to find some hotel bargains so you really have a lot of choices. The Best Western Seaport is $199/night plus tax for 2 queen beds on quikbook.com They also include cont. b/f I think. The Hampton Inn Chelsea is a more convenient location at that time of year and is $212/night plus tax for 2 queen beds. The Best Western Hanbee is also well within your budget for 2 queen beds and free cont. b/f.     If you want to be more centrally located and can put up with 2 double beds instead of queens, the Belvedere has 2 doubles (I saw it on hotels.com but it may be elsewhere) and the trendy Empire Hotel has 2 doubles on hotels for $197/night. Tax adds ~ 15% to prices.   </Owner>

    <Title>Snug Harbor Cultural Center</Title>
    <Owner>TPXB</Owner>
    <Body>     We planning on taking a trip over to Staten Island and would like to go to the Snug Harbor Cultural Center. Listed below are the directions for public transportation, which seem pretty straight forward. I'm sure it's easy to get a bus at the ferry terminal, but any insight on the ease of getting a bus back at Snug Harbor?    Thanks.    By Public Transportation:    From Manhattan: (by SI Ferry/bus) Travel to the SI Ferry located near Battery Park. You can take the 1/9 subway to South Ferry (make sure you are in the first 5 subway cars), or the 4/5/6 subway to Bowling Green. After a 25-minute ride across the Hudson, take the S40 bus from the ferry along Richmond Terrace to Snug Harbor (about 10-minute ride). Let the bus driver know that you want to get off at Snug Harbor.   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     It's very easy and very clearly marked. There are 3-4 bus ramps at the ferry terminal, with signs for which buses are at which ramp. Once outside, there are posts with the bus numbers on them. Do tell the driver you want to get off at Snug Harbor.    You need to cross the road for the entrance. There's a bus stop right in front. Take a look at the schedule before you go in, and note what times the buses leave to return to the ferry terminal.    Or, take a walk down the road a piece and have lunch at -- I'm not 100% sure of the name but it's something like Tugs. It's just a few minutes' walk in the same direction as the bus you just got off. On the water side. It's an industrial setting, but clean, and you get to see lots and lots of cute tug boats going by. (I'm a sucker for tug boats!) Good burgers too.    The Chinese Scholar's Garden at Snug Harbor is amazing!   </Owner>

No matter what time of year, it's worth a visit.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     To expand on that: the South Ferry station used to be a loop, and because of the sharp bend could not be extended the way most of the other old IRT stations were. As a result, only the number of cars that were in the original IRT consists could fit in the station -- so that mean the first five. Recently South Ferry station was entirely rebuilt. It is no longer a loop, but is instead a stub-end terminal: the trains end at a blank wall, and reverse direction when they leave, with the motorman walking from one end of the train to the other, as you would see him do at, say, Times Square on the #7, or New Lots Avenue. As a brand-new station, it was built with straight platforms long enough to accommodate all of a modern train. In addition, the new South Ferry station is connected with Whitehall Street (the old one wasn't), and you can now transfer from the 1 to the R.   </Owner>

There are 3-4 bus ramps at the ferry terminal, with signs for which buses are at which ramp. Once outside, there are posts with the bus numbers on them. Do tell the driver you want to get off at Snug Harbor. You need to cross the road for the entrance. There's a bus stop right in front. Take a look at the schedule before you go in, and note what times the buses leave to return to the ferry terminal.</Summary_2>

    <Title>Affordable Manhattan hotel?</Title>
    <Owner>BonitaLanita</Owner>
    <Body>     Well - this may sound crazy - but does anyone have a recommendation on an affordable and maybe  quot;nice quot; place to stay in the Manhattan area? And preferably for no more than $200 a night? I'm surprising my boyfriend with a trip to NYC for his 30th and since I'm paying for it all I can't really afford many of the more popular hotels. Any suggestions on a nice place to stay for a young couple would be awesome. And preferably near a subway station as I'm sure we'll want to see the sights. And a shared bathroom isn't that big of a deal as it seems that this is quite common around NYC.    Thanks!   </Body>

      <Owner>     Look at the Marriott Courtyard. They will be under construction at that time. So rooms will be hugely discounted, however, they don't want you to know that. Rooms are huge by NYC Standards. Extremely close to subway!   </Owner>

      <Owner>     All of the Courtyards are presently showing up at $300/night or more for those dates. So let me give you some other possibilities:    * the brand new Comfort Inn Manhattan Bridge on the Lower East Side - $153/night or $162/night. Rooms won't be spacious, but a fun neighborhood to stay in. Rates cheapest on its own website.  comfortinn.com/hotel-new_york-new_york-NY355  tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d1383001&#8230;    * the Hotel Newton on the Upper West Side at prices ranging from $118/night for room w/shared bath to $148/night for superior queen.  http://www.thehotelnewton.com  tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d112039-&#8230;    </Owner>

Also, you might want to look into Da Vinci Hotel 244 W 56th St (another excellent location) Smaller boutique style with decent overall reviews. Enjoy New York at Christmas time.....THE BEST!   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I have a reservation at Fitzpatrick Grand Central ( 3 star) for October, $211 per night through Easyclick...found on Bing. This is a nicer cheap hotel and nonsmoking! Bookings.com, had reservation at Helmsle Middle town, same price, 2star. That was a good price, but I kept looking, then Bing'd it. Only thing that sucked was that Easyclick req. pay at booking and then the hotel req. $50 per day security. I guess it's to cover the mini bar. They give it back at the end. I have 2 to chose from...watch the cancellation rules.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thank you all for your input.     I ended up going with the Hotel Newton. It had really good reviews on Tripadvisor and some other sites. I also by chance spoke with the reservations manager, Emilio, and he gave me an awesome rate. $215 for Sat. night and $105 per night for Sun. and Mon. Total came out to $492 for a standard queen room with private bath. Turns out they just raised their rates today, so I got lucky!   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A couple was visiting NYC during December 12-15 so needed information for an affordable and nice place to stay in the Manhattan area which cost less than $200 per night. Someone suggested them to stay in the Marriott Courtyard, it would cost cheaper as it was under construction. The other suggestion was to check the quikbook.com which had many postings and also to check bing.com. They were suggested to check new Comfort Inn, Da Vinci Hotel, Manhattan Bridge and hotel Newton because of the low price. The couple ended up going with the Hotel Newton as it offered good discount.</Summary_1>

    <Title>New York Knicks tickets</Title>
    <Owner>Oxford0910</Owner>
    <Body>     Hi all, I will be in New York from 15th December 2009 to 20th December 2009. I am hoping to get tickets for the Knicks/LA Clippers game when we are over there.    Does anybody know the best way to get tickets? We are looking to spend up to $100 for each ticket so would also appreciate advise on the best seating area in MSG to watch the action.    Thanks   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Try the Knicks website or the MSG website - either should direct you to ticketmaster, where you can buy your ticket online and collect at the will call window on the day of the game. The site also has a seating plan of the Garden. Anything in the 300s and below are generally cosidered to be good seats.    I've gone through this process a couple of times and had no problems - as long as ou remember to take the card you use to bok the tickets when you pick them up.    Simples   </Owner>

The pass does not guarantee entry into the show.It is what time you get there.Good luck but you should have no problem if you are not going during a school vacation.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     irisblue55 is correct... you may have passes but they don't guarantee you access inside unless you get there early enough. While I have never been to see GMA, I work for ABC News and colleagues have said the same thing.    I highly suggest going especially if you haven't seen a live tv broadcast in person. You may be surprised on the size of the studio and other things.    Have fun.   </Owner>

    <Title>Itinerary Help for Solo Traveler</Title>
    <Owner>emz_M</Owner>
    <Body>     Hi    This forum has been an essential resource in helping me research my first trip to New York, so firstly I&#8217;d like to thank all the contributors.     I&#8217;m a 28 year old female that&#8217;s never ventured outside of Europe and I will be travelling solo for the first time. I have wanted to go to New York ever since I can remember so to say that I&#8217;m excited would be a huge understatement. I&#8217;m a bit of a foodie and love the creative arts, specifically photography, graphic design and cinema.     I have created a brief itinerary for my 6 day trip, arriving on Saturday 17th October, leaving on Thursday 22nd October. I will be staying at the Affinia Dumont Hotel on 150 E 34th St. I would appreciate any assistance on how I could improve on what I have planned or anything of great importance that I&#8217;m missing out. I&#8217;m especially stuck on what to do on the arrival and departure days so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.    Saturday 17th October - Arrive at JFK at 16:40.     Sunday 18th October 2009  &#8226; Morning: Grand Central Terminal.

      <Owner>     WOW, sounds like someone did her homework!     SUN: The walk from the Ferry to Chinatown on Day 1 is about 15-20 minutes and is great. Walk right up Broadway past Bowling Green, Charging Bull, Trinity Church, Wall Street and St Pauls Chapel. Cut through beautiful City Hall Park and walk on Centre Street in front of the Muni Building and the Federal and State Courts. Make a right turn on Worth Street for two blocks and Voila. Chinatown. That night, when exploring DUMBO hit the art galleries at 111 Front Street, Jacques Torres and the waterfront park for some great photo ops.    TUE: I love that you just have an  quot;explore quot; going on here. Both the quaint West Village and the edgier East Village are great places to explore. Bet you find some really cool stuff here.    WED: After dinner, head to Union Square Park, New York's best people watching and hang out spot.     Hang loose and enjoy NYC   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Congratulations--- that is one of the best thought out itinerarys I have seen...    One slight modification and only as a suggestion not a criticism. On Wednesday between the two shows why go all the way downtown for that early dinner... I would look for something either on restaurant row which is 46th street between 8th and 9th avenues or walk over to 9th avenue where from 44th street to 56th street you have you choice of many many restaurants.. This keeps you in the same neighborhood as the theaters.      www.restaurantrownyc.com   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thank you both for the excellent suggestions.    @ bilmin09: I picked a restaurant I really wanted to go to without paying much attention to location but it may prove to be too much of an inconvenience. I will definitely look into other options closer to the Theatre District. Thanks for the advice.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     emz, Aldea is just 2 blocks from the 18th St. station for the #1 subway line. Board a subway car there and ride it to the 50th Street/Broadway, which is less than 1 block from Wicked's theatre. The subway ride itself shouldn't take more than 10 minutes, so if Aldea is a place you're keen on trying, I don't think you have to rule it out on the basis of geography.      </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A forum was about a solo traveler who was about to travel the New York first time. She was 28 year old female and had never ventured outside of Europe. She was planning to stay at the Affinia Dumont Hotel. She needed assistance to for planning. She was planning to visit Grand Central Terminal, Chinatown, Brooklyn, Dumbo, Manhattan, Madison Park, and Empire State Building. She was planning to eat at some of the good places and to shop at various places in NYC.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person shared her itinerary and asked for assistance on how to improve on what she has planned and advice on what to do on the arrival and departure days. Generally, people really liked the original poster's itinerary. One person noted that is is one of the best thought out itinerary she has ever seen. Some suggestions made were walking from the ferry to Chinatown on Day 1 for about 15-20 minutes, heading to Union Square Park for people watching, looking for place to eat on restaurant row.</Summary_2>

      <Owner>     The Sheraton is at 53rd Street and Seventh Avenue. All trains go to Penn Station. This is what you should do:    1) Take the AirTrain to the Newark Liberty train station.    2) Take the New Jersey Transit train to New York (NOT Newark!!!!!!!!!!) Penn Station.    3) Take the uptown E (Not the C! Not the A! Not ANYTHING going  quot;downtown quot;!!!!) subway train from Penn Station -- that is, the Eighth Avenue/34th Street stop -- to the Seventh Avenue station. Exit at the Seventh Avenue exit and you will be at your hotel.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     I think that what the people from Portland Oregon are asking is how long it takes from Newark Airport to New York Penn Station using AirTrain Newark / NJ Transit.    The answer is that it depends somewhat on day of the week and time of day. Weekdays from 5:00AM to 9:00PM the trains are very very frequent and very fast. After about 9:00PM there aren't as many trains from Newark to New York Penn (roughly two to three an hour after 9:00PM). From New York Penn to Newark on weeknights the trains are more frequent. On weekends there are at least three trains an hour until the middle of the evening. The train schedule is easy to find on www.njtransit.com (select Newark Airport as origin and New York Penn as destination - or vice versa).    It can take as little as 40 - 45 minutes from Terminal C to New York Penn however I like to tell people to allow a full hour.    The shuttles are a really really terrible idea. They're such a nightmare. Terrible. Dreadful. Avoid the shuttles.    People seem to have alot of complaints about Newark cabs. Drivers hold your bags hostage as they demand more money for tolls. It has never happened to me but I've read the stories on here.    Prearranging a car service is a good idea but it is such a pain with all the traffic getting into Manhattan. I've spent more than an hour sitting at the tunnel waiting. The train can take less than 45 minutes while it can take an hour and a half in a car (without a restroom and unable to stretch your legs). The trains are easy to use, well-marked, very safe and comfortable. The trains have restrooms, plenty of room to stretch your legs. Tickets are $15.00 per person (each way), buy your tickets using a credit card. I'm a big fan of AirTrain Newark / NJ Transit.   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A person wants to know whether he should take taxi or shuttle from Newark airport to The Sheraton hotel in midtown. he is in favor of taxi as he thinks that the taxi would be faster and cost effective between 3 people. A repliy suggests to take train and provides this link www.njtransit.com  www.visitnj.org. Another says that taxi is prone to traffic. Another person suggests to take the AirTrain to the Newark Liberty train station, take the New Jersey Transit train to New York Penn Station, and finally take the uptown E subway train from Penn Station to the Seventh Avenue station which is at the Sheraton Hotel.</Summary_1>

      <Owner>     Yes it is worth visiting- It runs along Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. Is easy to get to via subway... Any subway line that takes you to Borough Hall or Court Street in Brooklyn gets you within 5 blocks of Atlantic Ave... there are a few entertainment stages and lots of ethnically diverse booths with lots of great food.    There would be little mention of it because there are decent street fairs almost every week this time of year. Many tourists think that the only thing in Brooklyn is one end of a bridge and a pizza place named Grimaldi's. You have however found one of the better street fairs in all of the city. Come on over to Brooklyn and while you are there check out the Transit museum which is only 2 blocks away.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thanks, UrbanNYC - Yes, I've already looked at their website, was just wondering what people thought of it. Because it hadn't come up on the forum, I thought it mightn't be worth the effort. We're only in New York for one week, but did want to see Brooklyn and walk the B Bridge. We were thinking of catching the subway to Atlantic Ave and wondering back down through the Antic to Brooklyn Heights and with the help of the Idiot's Guide to Brooklyn, cross the bridge back to Manhatten at sunset. This also raises the question - Will everyone else have the same idea, ie Will the Bridge be backed at that time on that day?   </Owner>

      <Owner>     The bridge is always busiest on a Sunday but the walkway is wide enough to accommodate the crowds.. Your plan to go to Atlantic and then walk back towards Brooklyn Heights will work too or you can do it the other way as I suggested. I live in Brooklyn Heights and there is lots to see there too. I would eventually make your way to Montague street where there are shops and restaurants and the street is about 5 blocks long leading to the Brooklyn Promenade which you should see for a great view of Manhattan and make sure to bring your camera.   </Owner>

She was informed to check the festival website.Festival had few entertainment stages with ethnic diversity and great food. It was easy to reach through subway.

She had a plan of going to Atlantic Avenue through subway and coming back to Brooklyn Heights through the Brooklyn Bridge but was concerned about the traffic in the evening on the Brooklyn Bridge. Someone informed her that the bridge was always busiest on a Sunday but the walkway was wide enough to accommodate the crowds. She was suggested to change the plan.</Summary_1>

    <Body>     I've looked at the website, but still can't get an answer to my question. Is this just a sit-down, restaurant-type place, or can you just go in and get a cupcake to go?   </Body>

      <Owner>     It looks like it might be more of a restaurant than just a  quot;take-away quot; cupcake place. Anyone been there who knows for sure?   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I took a client and his family to 'Kyotofu' last year for after diner desert. The place is kind of small and it was loaded with young Japanese. I remember there was a line to get in. The deserts are cute and ..... ah ..... different. We were a group of 8 and got a table in the back room. I think there was also food on the menu but mainly it's desert place with different kinds of drinks. Can't recall cupcakes ..... I thought it was a lot of artsy Japanese looking stuff ..... with weird textures and odd taste.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thanks, Lotus! I read that theirs were voted  quot;best cupcake quot; by New York magazine, and I was going to add them to my list of places to try cupcakes when I'm there. I think I'll cross them off the list, because I don't really want to have to wait to be seated - just want to get a cupcake and go!   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Don't know about their Christmas decorations, but both the River Cafe and the Boathouse in Central Park are among the loveliest places for a special lunch in NYC.    The River Cafe has spectacular views of Manhattan and the Boathouse looks out on a serene lake in Central Park.     Happy Anniversary/Birthday !   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I think you should have lunch somewhere else as the food is not great.   But for the rest of i there is this little Indian place called Rose of India that every body who comes in says it is their birthday because they do a hilarious Happy Birthday song to anyone who says it is their birthday and you get a free dessert. It has cheesy Christmas decorations year round. You will have a REAL NY experience.   I do not know about Christmas decorations because there are so many religions and cultures here most restaurant owners do not want to alienate anyone who is of another faith. I second the River Cafe in Brooklyn but do not know if they have decorations for Christmas. You could go there for lunch and for fun go to Rose of India for dessert.   There s aalso Rolff's but the food is not great.  http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/rolfs/   </Owner>

    <Owner>mpjones75</Owner>
    <Body>      We are coming for a daytrip to New York next month but we are also in the planning stage for a longer trip this coming April. Is it better (or cheaper) to book rooms directly from the hotels web site or from other sources like travelocity, hotels.com, ect. We hope to get accomadations for 4 people with kitchenette as 2 of our group have special diet needs. Thank you for any information we can get.   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     its worth using a couple and seeing which is best such as :-    www.expedia.com  www.priceline.com  www.quikbook.com    and    www.kayak.com for flights   </Owner>

      <Owner>     There's never a simple answer to this. Some hotels may have better prices or better availability on third party websites. For example, you can sometimes find sale prices on the Affinia.com hotels on quikbook.com or hotels.com that are better than the hotels' own websites. Travelzoo.com historically has had some specials for Affinia hotels and there's usually nothing better than a travelzoo or travel-ticker.com sale.    Some hotels like the Beaconhotel.com don't discount on 3rd party websites. So in your shoes I'd book something cancelable now for the April trip and keep an eye out for specials on these other websites. Are you trying to sleep 4 adults in one suite? If yes and if it's 2 couples and you want a 2 bedroom apartment, your options for that are pricier and somewhat limited so post back. Very often 2 studio suites is cheaper than one 2 bedroom suite.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thank you so much for your help. Yes, it's 2 couples and actually we don't mind sharing the same bedroom as long as the beds are double or queen size--we are older couples (related) and travel with each other a lot. I certainly will check out the sites you both mentioned and will take your advice about booking a hotel while keeping my eyes open for specials. Do you advocate signing up for e-mails from the hotel sites? Once again thank you.   </Owner>

Why would you say that unless you have specific information? I would research the individual property since they are privately owned. If particularly concerned... the Better Business Bureau.

      <Owner>     Once you find a good rate at the aggregators, go to the hotel's site as it might be cheaper. If not, email the hotel and ask them to match the rate. Most of the time they will, and now you have a cancellable reservation booked directly with the hotel without a 3rd party. This is great in case something goes wrong.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I would recommend booking a car service with a fixed price. Alexa transportation is a co. based in Staten Island and all the drivers are ex police or firemen. They're very reliable and will be more likely to know their way around Staten Island.  limos.com/operators/alexa-transportation-cor&#8230;    If your Aunt is also arriving at LGA only a half hr. later, your sister might want to wait at the airport for her so they can travel together. If they don't travel together, I assume someone else will be at the house should your sister arrive before your Aunt?   </Owner>

      <Owner>        I agree that a car service is the way to go. While Yellow Cab drivers are legally obliged to take passengers anywhere in the 5 boroughs, there's no law that says they need to know their way around Staten Island, which is about twice as large as Manhattan. Unless your sister can give the driver street-by-street directions, things could get very expensive...and as the driver's not likely be able to pick up a return fare on SI, the temptation to  quot;take the scenic route quot; *might* be a factor.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thanks guys for all your advice! We thought about the cab idea, but that idea scared us because they might take us the  quot;scenic route quot; lol. AND my sister's only been to my Aunt's house couple times so she's really not familiar with the whole area.    Something with a fixed price is what we're leaning more towards...and not too pricey pls =)    How about Shuttles?     Yah, my aunt can't miss her meeting unfortunately. Is traffic bad during that time?     Thank you so much again!! =)   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I recommend Dial7 all the time but for this trip to Staten Island, I highly recommend using Alexa instead since they're based in SI and will know the area well. If you decide to us Dial7, make sure you have printed directions to the final destination in case the driver has a problem.   </Owner>

      <Owner>      quot;Thanks guys for all your advice! We thought about the cab idea, but that idea scared us because they might take us the 'scenic route' lol. quot;     You don't have any reason to fear this. It's in a cab driver's best interest to get you in and out as soon as possible.    </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A person needed advice for his sister for the transportation in the night from LGA Airport to Staten Island. Someone suggested him a NYC yellow cab as they were legally obliged to take passengers anywhere in the 5 boroughs. Someone also recommended the Alexa Transportation based in Staten Island. The drivers of Alexa Transportation were ex-police or fireman and were very reliable. A person was interested in a car with a fixed price and also into shuttles. Someone suggested that the shuttle in NY was not a good idea and dial7 car service could be an option.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person wanted to know the best option for her sister to get to Staten Island from LGA at around 11pm. Most people seem to agree that the way to go is a car service with a fixed price. One person recommended Alexa transportation, while another person recommended Dial 7. One person noted that she usually recommend Dial 7, but for a trip to Staten Island, she would recommend Alex instead because they know the area well.</Summary_2>

    <Title>accomodation in New York</Title>
    <Owner>mazza063</Owner>
    <Body>     My family and I (Myself, husband and 4 children (19,18,16,13) are planning to be in Mew York over New year. I am hunting down accomodation. We are on a budget and so I am wondering if anyone has any ideas on places to stay that do not cost an arm and a leg. If we needed to stay outside of New York city where would be a convienient place to look and still get to the city easily to do all of the attractions. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.      </Body>

      <Owner>     6 people is a lot in a hotel room. Would you consider splitting into 2 rooms? Say, yourself and your husband and thirteen year old, and the others in another room? If so, your options will broaden considerably.     Collection of Residence in Queens might suit:  http://www.collectionofresidences.com/    Keep in mind that apartment rentals are not the norm in NYC, unlike other cities in the world. In fact, most are illegal and there are also many scams around. Stick with hotels and apartment-style hotels.    Please do post your exact dates and budget to give you some options. Some suite hotels to get you started:  www.affinia.com  AKA  Salisbury Hotel  Beacon Hotel  Radio City Apartments  www.apartments2book.com   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Hi, I was looking for the same dates for some time. The best option I came up with for the same numbers was a suite at Affinia 50. Only downside is one bathroom. We ended up going with the Affinia Eastgate towers, as it was about the same price for a 2bed/2bath. However, Affinia 50 looked better for location and fitout. We are actually considering splitting out stay and heading up to DC for two nights. Good luck.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     You've picked a very expensive time to visit. I agree with all the advice you've received so far. Which airport(s) will you be using to come and go from NYC? That will determine which out of Manhattan options might be best for you.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     You might try contacting the Embassy Suites in lower Manhattan to see if they will accept a party of 6 (the online booking system will refuse to make a reservation for 6 people). One of their suites, however, would be cramped for 6: the 2-bedded bedrooms are equipped with just 2 double/full beds and I'm almost positive that the sleep sofa in the living rooms at the Embassy Suites also have double/full mattresses -- not the larger queen mattresses. But they may be willing to put a rollaway bed into one of their suites. The ES does offer a bountiful, and free, breakfast buffet which could a real plus for a family with teens.    One other possibility: the Hampton Inn  amp; Suites Riverwalk in Harrison, NJ -- good-sized rooms where the rooms for 3-4 people offer 2 queen beds, plus mini-refrigerator, microwave  amp; coffee maker. That Hampton Inn also gives its guests a free breakfast; not as extensive as the one at the Embassy Suites but more than just a simple continental breakfast. And transportation into Manhattan easy and inexpensive via the nearby PATH train. Plus, there's an indoor pool  amp; free airport transportation from/to Newark International Airport.   You could get rooms with either 2 queen beds or 1 king bed with sofa bed for $179/night (before taxes) by making a reservation through the hotel's own website; this $179/night rate requires no advance payment or deposit and can be canceled, upon reasonable notice, with no financial penalty. Booking 2 rooms would also give you an extra bathroom -- a great bonus when you're trying to get 6 people out the door in the AM.  http://www.hamptoninnandsuitesnewark.com  tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g46494-d523919-&#8230;    This, however, would not be a great choice if you'll be flying into/out of JFK or La Guardia Airport.    </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A family of six was looking for an accommodation in New York during New Year time.The family was willing to spend 420$ per night on accomodation. Someone suggested to stay in hotel and not in apartment rentals as it is illegal in New York. The suggested hotels were Affinia, Hotel Beacon Hotel Radio City, Embassy Suites in New York City and Hampton Inn, Suites Riverwalk in Harrison in New Jersey. Some of the suggested hotels are close to airport and path stations.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person wanted to know a good place to stay for 6 people on a budget from December 28 to January 10, 2009, no more than $420 a night. She doesn't mind staying outside of New York City, but wants somewhere convenient to get into the city.  Someone suggested splitting into 2 rooms and for her to check out Collection of Residences in Queens, Affinia, Salisbury Hotel, Beacon Hotel, and Radio City Apartments. One person said her best option was Affinia 50 wit Affinia Eastgate Towers as an alternative. Another person suggested contacting the Embassy Suites in lower Manhattan and the Hampton Inn Suites Riverwalk in Harrison, NJ. In terms of transportation from the Hampton Inn in Harrison to NYC, it is easy and inexpensive via the nearby PATH train. In addition, the Hampton Inn offers free transportation to and from Newark International Airport.</Summary_2>

      <Owner>     Yep, the Friends lot is in Warner Bros Studio LA - we went there last May and visited the exteriors, the Central Perk set (which is in the props dept now) even the Central Park bits are filmed on a small piece of grass/tree area - its surprising if you cover one eye how big a little piece of garden can look and filming with a single lens thats how you get the impression its much bigger. It really opened our eyes to see just how much stuff is filmed there and we think it all location - CSI, ER, Pushing Daisies,Spiderman etc..   </Owner>

      <Owner>     You can't book the Staten Island Ferry, just show up.  Also, you cannot book a carriage ride - however why would you want to approx $50.00 for a 10/15 minute ride - even though it is supposed to be longer - the horses are not in good shape at all and treated very poorly, I'd give this a skip. Maybe a rickshaw ride would serve you better.  Poppa   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I would also suggest the New York Party Shuttle tours, which is what we did on our first day. The tour we choose lasted about 5 hours, but you get to see most of the Tourist sight including a trip on the Staten Island Ferry, passing the Satue of Liberty, and too many to mention, check their web site for full details. You are escorted by knowledgeable guides throughout, its fun and the time flies past. This can be book in advance.    We also did the pedicab tour of Central Park which was fantastic and such a laugh, but also very informative, history and film locations etc.    You will have a ball, I am returning in Nov. Once you have been you will be hooked!!!!x   </Owner>

She also mentioned that she already planned on booking ESB (Empire State Building), but wondered what else. One person noted that the original poster shouldn't both doing the ESB because the TOTR is much better. Another person suggested booking the cruise to go to the Ellis Island or to the Statue of Liberty itself ahead of time. Broadwaybox.com was recommended as the place to book Broadway shows and plays. Many people seem to say that the Ferry to Staten Island doesn't need booking.  One person also suggested the New York Party Shuttle tours, which lasted 5 hours and can be booked in advance.</Summary_2>

      <Owner>      gt; gt;would I still be able to get back in to the restaurant after the fireworks? gt; gt;  Not sure what this means. Are you thinking of eating, leaving for the fireworks, then going back to the restaurant? That's not going to happen. If the restaurant is even still open, they're not going to hold your table for an hour while you go over to wait for the fireworks.  Is that what you're asking about? Or do you mean something else?   </Owner>

      <Owner>     As for going back to the restaurant. It will depend on what the rest of the crowd does... In some places shortly after 12:30 or 1am people start clearing out because they have been there all night.... in other places the party is just getting started at Midnight and will be going all night....If there is room I am sure you can work out a deal to come back in but you very well may not have the same table. You probably would not be back until about 1:15am. You will need to fight your way back through the crowd and back to the restaurant.   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A person needed information about the Rosa Mexicana Restaurant. He was planning to visit the place with his two teenage children who were 16 and 18 in age and was planning to attend fireworks in the Central Park.He had a plan of coming back to restuarant for some drink. Someone suggested that the restaurant is good to attend with teens but not the bar and the location was probably 15-20 mins walk from the central park. Going back to the restaurant would depend on the action of the rest of the crowd.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person wanted some information regarding Rosa Mexicana because she was planning on booking a table for New Year's Eve. She also wanted to know if they have entertainment, what would be a good time to eat so that they can get over to Central Park before the fireworks and if there would be a problem taking two teenage children there. Several people said that it takes 15-20 minutes to walk from the restaurant to the park. As long as there's no age minimum to get in, there shouldn't be any problem for the teenagers.</Summary_2>

      <Owner>     Thanks for all the info. I am looking to spend no more than $300/night but if i can get anything better that that it would be great. I live in Costa Rica and is just my second time in New York. Actually I am attending the Expo on the Javitz Center to promote our vacation rentals properties in Tamarindo, Costa Rica, so we reserved a booth for our company.    The Expo is only Oct 10-11 and the rest of the time is for appointment with travel agencies, so i don't really need to be around teh Javitz Center the entire time. I have a fried in Brooklyn so I may stay in his place for a couple of nights after the expo, so i am looking forward to get a hotel room on Thursday evening (flight arrives at 9:55 pm JFK), then Friday head to the Javitz for all the prep work in the booth and then stay in the same place for the following two nights Sat-Sun and then after that maybe stay with my friend.     Thanks for the help.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     That weekend is a holiday weekend here with banks and schools closed on the Monday. That plus the travel expo is pushing prices very high. The area immediately around the Javits Center doesn't have a lot to offer. The best option I see that's cancelable is the Shelburne Murray Hill for just under $300/night PLUS tax (15%) on hotels.com    The Travel Inn is a decent budget hotel and is $213/night plus tax on booking.com    The Hampton Inn Times Square South at 337 West 39th Street is very close to the Javits Center and has a prepay rate that's not cancelable of $264 plus tax.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     My strong advice, which many here will agree with, is that you just head on over to 9th Avenue anywhere between 42-60 streets -- this will not be a long walk to your theater. There are about a million restaraunts of all varieties and all price points. That's what my wife and I do before we go to a show, we head over there and find a place that meets our fancy. We make sure to be there by 6:00 and have never needed a reservation and I never wear coats or ties. I think you'll really be surprised by how well this works.    Ditto for 10th Ave but not quite as many places to eat though I really adored this Ethiopian place, on 10th, the one time we ate there http://www.shebanyc.com/   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Actually, for South Pacific I don't agree with that advice. South Pacific while considered a Broadway show is actually playing at Lincoln Center which is NOT that close to the restaurants along 9th  amp; 10th aves. in the 40's-50's. Telepan, Josephina, O'Neal's (prob. the cheapest option) and Fiorella are all good. 2 of my favorites for near Lincoln Center are Cafe Luxembourg where you can have anything from a burger to a 3 course prix fixe for $38 and La Boite En Bois which also has a prix fixe for $40..   </Owner>

      <Owner>     PS I have to add that $150 for 3 people including a few drinks each really means only spending ~ $50-60 for food for 3. Drinks average $10/each (so $60); tax is over 8% and with a tip of 15% you're at your budget. That can be done at an ethnic restaurant like Ollie's for Chinese or if you have light meals (burgers, omelettes etc.) from the brasserie menu at Cafe Luxembourg. There's no reason to make the pre theater dinner a fancy meal. Why not save that for another night when you're not rushing to a show.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     There are a few Dean and Deluca's... what is the address..... You can use hopstop for this since it has a walking component or you can figure it out yourself..      Once you have the cross street subtract that number from 42nd which is about where Times Square begins.    If it is lets say 14th street--- subtract 14 from 42 and you get 28---- In Manhattan the rule is roughly 20 blocks to a mile so 28 blocks would be just over a mile' how fast can you walk a mile ? That is your answer.    It gets a little tricky if you are going downtown past 1st street but that's where you can use either hopstop or google maps   </Owner>

      <Owner>     While it's just 2.3 miles as the crow flies, your walk down Broadway will give you hundreds of great photos and a lifetime of experiences. You might never make it to D amp;D.     You'll be doing an awful lot of sightseeing along the way, because Broadway has the best of Manhattan on it or nearby.   200 years ago, a commission was formed to layout the city's streets. Broadway was a pre-exsting condition. That is, it's a road that predates all the streets and avenues. Indeed, it predates European settlement here. It's been in use for thousands of years.   What the Commissioners' Plan came up with was that, in the 2-4 miles where Broadway is diagonal to the up-down shape of Manhattan, a small park would be formed wherever it crossed an avenue. Also, the perpendicular street there would be twice as wide, have two-way traffic, and be devoted to businesss, not homebuilding.   This is why most streets are narrow, but some are twice as wide. BTW, those streets usually have subway stops on them so, if you need a train, use your Metrocard to get on a bus on one of those streets, then transfer to the train.     These squares are Verdi, Lincoln, Columbus (Circle), Times, Herald, Madison and Union.     You're going to sightsee through Times Square. Heading south you'll see the Fashion Building, the Liz Claiborne Building and the Nygaard Building in The Fashion District before you get down to Herald Square. And in HS you'll see Macy's,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2vmgbsNbs Daffy's, Manhattan Mall, The Herald Clock, and maybe make a side trip to the Empire State Building one block east.  Then walk down through the Wholesale District to Madison Square. From the UK? Churchill's mother lived over there... From the Southwest US? General Worth (Fort Worth is named for him) is buried over here... Military vet from any WW1 allied country? The flagpole straight ahead will be lit on 11/11 at 11 AM.     Then comes the Flatiron and other grand old Ladies Mile buildings, followed by Union Square...    ...You get the picture. D amp;D - jestily called  quot;Bean  amp; Beluga quot; for is prices, by a former food writer - is 16 blocks south of Union Square.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     What are you going to do when you get to New Rochelle. Since it is not in the city you will need transportation of some sort to get around. In that case you may want to rent a car at Jfk and drive. The one day cost would be equal to the taxi fare and you will be in control.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     And is the wedding in the hotel or do you need to plan how to get there. Public transportation is fine in a big city but limited outside of the city. You need to think through the entire time there to determine your best way of getting around. You may contact the hotel, sometimes they have the info on the best way to get directly there from airports.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Your combined cost of getting from JFK to New Rochelle and back to JFK -- using the Airport Express Service bus and MetroNorth -- will be $40-45 round-trip, depending on whether you'll riding the MetroNorth train at times it deems to be peak or off-peak.    The New Rochelle train station is only 1/2 mile from the Residence Inn, and according to MetroNorth's page re: the New Rochelle station, Bluebird Taxi has its office right at the train station. Sounds easy peasy :-)  as0.mta.info/mnr/stations/station_detail.cfm&#8230;   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>KLMTrinidad needed advise for the best way to get from JFK to New Rochelle using public transport. He/she knew that the taxi would cost $80-85 USD which was quite expensive. Crans suggested taking a train as New Rochelle was on the New Haven line of the Metro-North Railroad.  He/she was also suggested to a bus from JFK to Grand Central Station, where one can board the Metro-North train. Bilmin09 suggested taking a rental car at JFK and driving to New Rochelle because it would be useful for transportation in New Rochelle and would cost same as the taxi fare. KLMTrinidad would be attending a wedding in New Rochelle and he/she wanted to know whether it would be easy to take taxi from the station. Blue Bird Taxi -914-632-0909 could be an option. KLMTrinidad needed information about the taxi charge from the station to the Marriott Residence Inn. CockleCove informed that the combined cost of getting from JFK to New Rochelle and back to JFK -- using the Airport Express Service bus and MetroNorth -- would be $40-45 round-trip, depending on whether KLMTrinidad was riding the MetroNorth train at times it deems to be peak or off-peak.

KLMTrinidad also wanted to know whether there would be a lot of stairs.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person asked for advices on the best public transportation option from JFK to New Rochelle. A few people mentioned Metro-North train + taking Bluebird Taxi from train station to the hotel. The hotel is not far from the train station so the fare should not be much.</Summary_2>

      <Owner>     The media report that up to half our population will likely be infected. While that sounds frightening, regular seasonal flu kills far more people. The curious thing about the swine flu seems to be that young people are more susceptible than old, which is the opposite of seasonal flu.     Anyway, if you can get vaccinated, it's a good idea. We're a little late here, our swine flu vaccines won't be available for another few weeks.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Not based on any medical background, just personal opinion, I'd just say if you plan to take the shot, take it sooner rather than later...as far from your travel time as possible just in case the shot itself gives you any ill effects. It's miserable to be sick while traveling.     I got an email the other day on ways to reduce chances of getting the flu and think it's worth posting here:     quot;1. Frequent hand-washing (well highlighted in all official communications).     2.  quot;Hands-off-the-face quot; approach. Resist all temptations to touch any part of face (unless you want to eat, bathe or slap).     3. Gargle twice a day with warm salt water (use Listerine if you don't trust salt). *H1N1 takes 2-3 days after initial infection in the throat/ nasal cavity to proliferate and show characteristic symptoms. Simple gargling prevents proliferation. In a way, gargling with salt water has the same effect on a healthy individual that Tamiflu has on an infected one. Don't underestimate this simple, inexpensive and powerful preventative method.     4. Similar to 3 above, clean your nostrils at least once every day with warm salt water.     Not everybody may be good at JalaNeti or Sutra Neti (very good Yoga asanas to clean nasal cavities), but blowing the nose hard once a day and swabbing both nostrils with cotton buds dipped in warm salt water is very effective in bringing down viral population.    5. Boost your natural immunity with foods that are rich in Vitamin C (Amla and other citrus fruits). If you have to supplement with Vitamin C tablets, make sure that it also has Zinc to boost absorption.    6. Drink warm liquids as much as you can. Drinking warm liquids has the same effect as gargling, but in the reverse direction.     They wash off proliferating viruses from the throat into the stomach where they cannot survive, proliferate or do any harm.    All these are simple ways to prevent, within means of most households, and certainly much less painful than to wait in long queues outside public hospitals. quot;   </Owner>

    <Title>Becco on 46th</Title>

    <Body>     Heading into the City in a couple of weeks - has anyone eaten at Becco on 46th btw'n 8/9th?  It is owned by Lydia Bastianich (sp) the Food Network personality who is also associated with Batali.  It will be after a matinee and cocktails - around 7:00 PM on a Saturday - going to make rezzies   tonight.  Thanks in advance for any input.  Poppa   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Yes I have eaten at Becco as well as a number of places on 46th street. It was the hot place last summer but while you might be coming from a matinee that will be prime time for those going to an evening performance and if you can you would be better off doing something else for an hour and making your reservation for 8pm after the theater crowd has cleared out..   </Owner>

      <Owner>     If you hit them on a good night, the pasta can be excellent (lobster risotto a standout). Some nights it's fairly ordinary though. And since they expanded their space a few years ago, the tables are packed very tightly together. Still a good choice of inexpensive bottles of wine.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Becco (becconyc.com) is a personal favorite and famous for its Sinfonia di Pasta. Food and service is always outstanding here. The restaurant is always busy, but especially so at pretheatre dining hours, so 7:pm on a Saturday will be particularly busy. I would suggest making a reservation for 8:pm when things will have calmed down a bit. Along with the pasta special, we especially enjoy the ossobuco. We always find this place to be an exceptional value, particularly noting the extensive wine list at #25 per bottle. Also notable are the ossobuco and the dessert sampler of excellent in house made desserts.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Kayak doesnt sell fares. They just consolidate information. But its one of the best to see all the options. Once you find something, you are directed to the airline's website.    I used kayak to search Charleston-LGA for Nov 3-6 (as an example):    Non-stop on US Airways is around $400. Airtran has slightly cheaper but the flights are One-Stop.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I've driven several hours to Charlotte for the super low fares between New York and Charlotte. I travel to South Carolina a fair amount but I am always faced with two choices - pay a ridiculous fare for the convenience of flying into the airport where I'm going (it is very nice / super convenient) *or* drive from / to Charlotte and save a huge amount of money.    Sometimes what I do is I try to find a cheap one-way rental car and I'll fly into Charlotte and drive, fly back from my destination *or* fly into my destination, pick up the car and return it in Charlotte. It pays for the car.   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A person was trying to book air ticket for his friend from South Carolina to NYC and wanted to know some good websites to book tickets at discounted prices. The suggested websites were kayak.com, travelzoo.com,expedia.com,cheaptickets.com,farecompare.com and airfarewatchdog.com. Someone suggest him to take Jetblue flight as it flies between NYC and Charlotte. The other suggestion was to take an air train as it was slightly cheaper than the aero plane.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person wanted to know good websites to find cheap flight tickets in US. kayak.com, tripadvisor.com, travelzoo.com, cheaptickets.com are some of the recommendations. Others suggested checking Southwest and JetBlue flights, especially JetBlue as it flies between NYC and Charlotte which is the route the original poster was looking for. The original poster ended up decided on JetBlue as it offered the cheapest price.</Summary_2>

      <Owner>     There are not competing taxi companies in New York City--all taxis are official, city-regulated yellow cabs. You step into the street and hail one. More info here:  tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60763-s304/New-York-&#8230;  Don't know about Newark, sorry.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     As Crans noted, you do not have competing taxi companies in NYC. To make even more explicit what she said, you cannot telephone for a taxicab in New York City. The ONLY ways to get a taxicab are to find one at a taxi stand (such as at the airport, or in front of a train station), or to hail one on the street. When that hailed taxi pulls up in front of you, you will not be able to tell by looking at it who owns it (whether a taxi company, or the driver who is behind the wheel, or whoever) as all taxicabs in NYC are painted the same color (yellow) with the same markings as approved by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. If you want to call a company for a car that will then be dispatched to you from a central location, that vehicle is not a taxicab, but is instead a limo or a livery car.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     The best  quot;taxi quot; in Manhattan is known as the subway. Unless there is some physical reason you cannot take the subway (can't navigate steps) using a taxi as your mode of transport in Manhattan is a waste. A waste of money, but also in many cases a waste of time as the subway is running under the city and does not have to deal with bumper to bumper traffic that taxis often have to.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I plan on using the subway for most of my transportaion, yes. Walking is my 2nd choice. Taxi is last resort or late night backup if needed. I rarely use taxis, but sometimes they are nice for those spur-of-the-moment short trips. I haven't visited a large city yet that I didn't use the public transportation except in Caracas, Venezuela. But then again, I immediately headed out to the country with my rental car after spending the night there. I've used public transport in Cleveland here (the  quot;rapid quot; trains and buses), Toronto, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Diego, Tijuana, Pittsburgh, Boston, Honduras, Guatemala (quite interesting), Brazil, and Spain.     Despite all that, my kids like the subway too...   </Owner>

      <Owner>     You should not choose a taxi because of the hour. The subway is safer at 3 in the morning than it is at 3 in the afternoon, largely because a vastly disproportionate amount of the very, very little subway crime that does exist is committed by high school kids picking on each other. When the little darlings head home around 8 or 9 in the evening, crime in the subway involving personal confrontations largely disappears. With an average of one robbery for every 4 and a half million passengers, you have a better chance of getting hit by lightning than of being robbed on the subway in NYC.   </Owner>

    <Owner>Jaegerchick</Owner>
    <Body>     I have been looking at tickets for Radio City Christmas Spectacular on various websites. Mainly ticketmaster, but another one has tickets  amp; its called Razorgator. Ticketmaster can offer tickets in Orchastra row F seats 401  amp; 402, or 1st Mezz row C seats 401  amp; 402 or Razorgator has tickets (no seat numbers given) in Section 5 row B.     Can I ask which seats are best? Is Razorgator safe to use? Sorry don't know anything on them. If anyone can email back with any info it would be most appreciated. Many thanks.   </Body>

      <Owner>     discounts on these shows are always around because they do a tremendous number of shows... each day.. I would keep an eye on the internet for discounts// I am sorry I have never heard of razorgate but be careful if you don't get confirmation from somebody don't use it as there are a number of scams this time of year and we are starting to see them.... Radio City is a huge huge hall and I would say that the tickets are probably as priced the more you pay the better your seats are going to be but for this show you do not have to be on top of the stage and the front mezzenene would be fine... You certainly do not have to buy the best tickets to have a good view.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Many 3rd-party ticket brokers don't tell you in advance precisely what seats their tickets are for. If that's the most detailed description razorgator gives you, you're buying a pig in a poke. There is no one section 5, even on razorgator's own seating chart for Radio City Music Hall; tickets numbered in the 500's are in the section just to the left of the center section, but they're found at every level: orchestra and the multiple tiers above the orchestra. So you could be in the 3rd mezzanine. Not that left of center seats in the 2nd row of the 3rd m would be wretched seats, but sounds like you want more assurance of what you'll be getting for your money.     Those 400-numbered seats from Ticketmaster you're considering are in the center section; I'd pick the first mezzanine rather the orchestra for this production; you'll have a better appreciation of the choreography and staging from there than in seats in the orchestra closer to the stage.   </Owner>

    <Body>     I have a great deal at the Pierre this weekend and a pretty good deal at the Palace with club room access. Pierre would be about $400 cheaper over 3 nights. Anyone have an opinion about which is better. Have stayed at Palace and the corner rooms are pretty big but have wanted to stay at Pierre but do not like really small rooms. Any help would be great...I have 3 hours to cancel. I want a luxurious room and like my good deals. thanks.   </Body>

      <Owner>     $400 cheaper at the Pierre---- go for it although I have not heard anything one way or the other about the recent renovations... but i don't think you will be disappointed with the Pierre--- it's not like you are comparing the Palace with hotel 99.   </Owner>

The Pierre has no Executive King rooms; there are Executive King suites which are 700 square feet in area, so certainly not  quot;really small. quot;    If you don't hold a reservation for an Executive King suite (or aren't certain that's what you've got), give the Pierre a ring and ask about the square footage of the room they're holding for you.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I understand, but without knowing what you might/will be upgraded to, we'd be engaging in sheer speculation as to the size of the room you'll get there. Plus, most of us don't actually measure our hotel rooms while in them, and in the absence of measurements, you can't be certain that someone else's sense of  quot;large quot; squares with your definition of that.    Don't be shy about letting the Pierre know that you're calling because you're trying to decide between it and the Palace. Knowing that the room size is your concern may prompt them to bump you to a larger room than might otherwise be the case.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Stout is a decent pub near there. Or, as Lotuspath suggested, 32nd St between Broadway and 5th is full of Korean restaurants. Some are very cheap.   www.stoutnyc.com    Lotus - you clearly don't know anything about Tamworth. It's like Nashville. But with sheep.  http://www.tamworthcountrymusic.com.au/   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Good to know Kate ..... it's only surprising since country music in the US is a very distinct genre here in the USA that even Americans outside of Nashville have a hard time cracking without the proper credo and pedigree. (well ..... except that Canadian/Swiss babe Shania Twain, but she's soooo 'hot')    Anway .... ah .... well sure Keith is now married to Nicole Kidman ..... but what do we know about the girl with all the 'cats' in that song ..... what about his EX- girlfriend? What do we know about her?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp0Q3UJHrkU   </Owner>

      <Owner>     They are all really nice and generally have the same type of merchandise. If the weather cooperates check out both the Union Square and Bryant Park markets.    The Grand Central market is indoors, and the whole terminal is worth a visit and a look around, with nice places to eat on the lower lever.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     In the nearly 10 years I've lived in NYC, the Union Square Holiday Market has always opened the day after Thanksgiving and closed on Xmas Eve. Safe to assume it will be the same this year.    Walking around the stalls is one of my new favorite holiday traditions. Even though a lot of the booths are the same year to year, there is something so comforting and enjoyable about strolling through the packed aisles on a chilly evening.    I hope you enjoy it!   </Owner>

    <Title>Christmas Spectacular</Title>
    <Owner>VirginiaDCgir...</Owner>
    <Body>     Hi everyone.    I apologize in advance if this is a stupid question. I have checked out some of the old threads, but couldn't really find an answer, so here goes...    As we'll be in New York for Christmas, we would really like to see the Christmas Spectacular show and I was wondering which day might be less packed - Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.     I realize it's probably all a matter of personal preference, but I was wondering if any of the locals might know when it is generally more busy.    Thanks   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Mid week (tues-wed) is always less crowded for things NYC based... 1. people tend to come for long weekends and then depart (thurs-Monday) 2. the local working stiffs like me are working and not going to shows. The Radio City Music Hall shows have extensive schedules and their tickets are always being offered somewhere at substantial discounts for the shows not doing well (like 2 for 1) so keep an eye out for that and review the schedule first to see what your options are but don't buy too early and don't pay full price..   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Well, as a fellow tourist, I must say that I probably do pay too much for tickets as I pay for them way ahead of time to avoid missing the experience. I'm also very picky as to where I sit and this is achieved by buying ahead of time. Perhaps it boils down to what is more important to you - seeing the event and sitting where you want or saving money. As far as which is more packed (Christmas Eve or Christmas Day) try calling Ticketmaster and ask them which has more tickets available. Just a thought.   </Owner>

    <Body>     From today's TImes:  ------------------------------  Afzal Hossain is the New York City subway&#8217;s newest customer assistant, and he is not happy about it.       After nearly 300 station agents were removed from the system late last month because of hard fiscal times, the task of guiding passengers and monitoring late-night riders has fallen to unsuspecting Samaritans like Mr. Hossain, a snack vendor in the Times Square station.    With a nearby booth now unattended, Mr. Hossain&#8217;s day has become filled with questions from lost tourists, anxious riders and pleading, sometimes screaming requests from stroller-pushing straphangers trying to open a service gate.     &#8220;It&#8217;s all day long,&#8221; Mr. Hossain said wearily, peering at the darkened booth just beyond the turnstiles. (In five minutes, he was accosted by three confused riders.) &#8220;When I get a chance, I tell them go this way, go that way. But sometimes, I&#8217;m serving a customer so I don&#8217;t say anything.&#8221;  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Seems to me that every crisis presents an opportunity..If some company in the private sector...a website perhaps...wanted to exploit the inefficiencies of the system, that would present a powerful branding vehicle.     But where could they find a pool of people who know their way around the subway, and who actually seem to ENJOY giving advice to to total strangers???? And if those people were also gullible enough to dispense such information for little or NO compensation...the possibilities are intriguing.    Just sayin'   </Body>

      <Owner>     When I was in Indiana, I went to an Italian restaurant. The quality was essentially old pasta with Ragu.     One of the joys of eating out in NYC is that the food is often prepared by people who grew up in the country. They are cooking from their Mama's recipes. The boros of New York City are famous for their international cuisine. The poster provided a glimpse of the variety that is Queens. The real Little Italy - now in the Bronx. Authentic Russian? Brighton Beach in Brooklyn. There is great authentic food all over NYC. Dig In.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     There are great Italian places in all 5 Bouroughs these days. Great food is no more than 15 minutes from anyones door in NYC.    NOTE to visitors - that 15 minutes is WALKING - not driving and in most cases folks live within 5 minutes of good food.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     You betcha Jimmy. In Brooklyn we certainly have our share of delicious Italian food.     As a Big Apple Greeter, I often take folks around. I stopped into La Villa with three Swedes in tow. Now, I love La Villa and eat there a lot. It's my local go to Italian place. But it is certainly not on the list of famous NYC Italian restaurants. It's strictly a local joint. Yet, seeing it through the eyes of visitors was a revelation. The great food that I was used to was thought to be amazing by my guests. Its a wonderful thing.   </Owner>

    <Body>     I'm traveling to NYC for the week of Thanksgiving, and looking a the best deal on accomodations - but I'm hoping to find a suite because I'll be with my adolescent son and 70 year old mother - and I think a seperate bedroom will make everyone more comfortable. I keep pouring through the  quot;NYC Deals quot; lists but its hard to sort out what applies to that week and I can't tell if any have suites. Any help would be so appreciated.   </Body>

      <Owner>     That probably is the case... you don't want to stay in a place you find for $99 or they might put your 70 year old mother to work making beds.... You need to be realistic on your rates . That week is going to be expensive.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     How old is your son? If he's 13 or under then the Eastgate Tower (affinia hotel) have a one bed room suite (2 beds) for $192 + taxes ($228 all in) but it's a pay in advance rate and non refundable. This room has a separate living area with a sofa bed.    If he's over 13 (then considered an adult) it's $232 + taxes ($274) and again it's pay in advance. Same room as above.    https:/&#8230;   </Owner>

      <Owner>     $99 is a next to impossible price for a room in Manhattan let alone a room for 3 or a suite. Unless you're female ( I can't tell ) and will share the bedroom with your Mother while your son sleeps on a sofabed, I don't see how a suite will work.    There are only 2 suite hotels in/near the theater district- Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square and the Blakely hotel which has some 1 bedroom suites. Both will be much more money. The Metro Hotel has some family suites with 2 bedrooms but they are $295/night plus tax (15%) on those dates. I think your only hope of getting anything close to $99/night is staying outside Manhattan. How are you getting to NYC? If flying, which airport?   </Owner>

    <Title>Tight Budget - Hotel Help</Title>
    <Owner>Ohio683</Owner>
    <Body>     We'll be in New York from December 3-6 which I hear is the most expensive weekend to travel there. It's just a typical sight-seeing trip with maybe a little shopping. There are 4 of us going and researching all the hotels is a daunting task. I was wondering if anyone had any info on the following hotels. Thanks!    Ramada Long Island City    Days Inn Long Island City    Holiday Inn Express Maspeth    Country Inn and Suites New York City    Quality Inn Long Island City    I should add that we are obviously not looking for anything fancy, just a place to sleep.   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     First, I would axe the Holiday Inn in Maspeth--that's not really convenient for visiting the city.  What is your nightly budget?   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Did you know that there are traveler reviews here on TA for each of those properties? They're here on TA, but under the names of their Queens  quot;towns quot;, not as New York City hotels. Here's the Long Island City round-up:  tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g48080-Long_Island_Ci&#8230;    And yes, that first weekend in December is one of the very priciest times in the entire year (and many places in Manhattan are already sold out); you've done a good job of scoping out some good alternatives. Are you driving from Ohio or flying, if flying which airport are you using?   </Owner>

      <Owner>     For convenience of location alone, the Country Inn and the Quality Inn are in the best spots, followed by the Ramada. The Days Inn is not all that far from the subway, but is in a really unpleasant and ugly spot, surrounded by endlessly busy roads and elevated subway tracks. The Holiday Inn Express is not convenient to mass transit at all, and should be completely eliminated from consideration.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Agree it would help to know which airport. If JFK or LGA, the Country Inn  amp; Suites in Long Island City is a good option and it's brand new. You might check Hotwire and see if there's anything at your budget. If you all plan on sharing 1 room, try to get something with 2 queen beds rather than 2 doubles. The Best Western Seaport and the Hampton Inn Seaport are not the most central but in Manhattan, have rooms with 2 queens and generally include free cont. b/f.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     More pluses for the Country Inn  amp; Suites: all their units are equipped with a microwave, mini-refrigerator, coffee maker; you get a free breakfast; and their 2-bedded rooms are equipped with queen beds :-)    Think the Quality Inn is also fine for ease of commuting into Manhattan, but if I'm wrong, I trust others will set the record straight on that :-)   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I would check all the hotels listed by Tripadvisor as Long Island City.  Most are probably near the subway stops for the N and W subway lines.    It's a quick 5 minute trip to Bloomingdales from there. Far more convenient to most of midtown Manhattan than other alternatives.     Also if you are flying in to LGA it's pretty much the same area and possible to use the bus for $2.25 or a bus/subway connection at the same price.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I just glanced at them   the ones in Long Island City   WOW some are really expensive!    I have no experience with any of them, but i noticed that the Days Inn sounds cheap and is near a Romanian Restaurant I went to recently.  The area is known as Sunnyside and very close to the subway's R line?    Busy well lit major street and I'd guess some good food choices as well.  If you pretty much just need a bed and a shower it could be hard to beat.   </Owner>

    <Title>Will tourist attractions be open around New Year?</Title>
    <Owner>Belly1505</Owner>
    <Body>     My boyfriend and l are coming to New York on the 29th December. He has been before but it's my first trip so l am understandably excited! We land in the evening of the 29th [Tuesday] and leave on the evening of the 3rd [Sunday].     So far l am thinking essential things to see are - The Statue of Liberty and Staten Island ferry, Top of the Rock, Ground Zero, Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, a museum [l prefer modern art and sculptures etc, any idea which would be best?] and where we can fit it in a trip to the sales! Is there anything else that we should definitely try and see?    Next question, will all these things be open? Or will they be shut on New Year Eve/Day? Also what about the sales? In the UK they start on Boxing Day or the day after, is it the same over there?    Thanks!   </Body>

Many of the things you list like Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge Ground Zero, Staten Island Ferry are free and never close. Some things close on New Year's Day but there are plenty of things open. Here's a list from last year  newyorkology.com/archives/&#8230;whats_open_new.php   </Owner>

      <Owner>      quot;do you get the day off as a bank holiday at least? quot;    We really don't refer to our holidays as bank holidays either, as far as I know. I think Federal Holiday is more often used.    But to answer your question it really depends on what day of the week Christmas is. I it is on a Sunday, many places will give Monday (26th) as a holiday. If Christmas is a Saturday, Friday (24th) will be a holiday.     For example in 2005, Christmas was a Sunday, so the Federal Holiday was Monday. What individual employers do depends on the business and   whether they are jerks or afraid of a revolt.    2005 Example  opm.gov/Operating_Status_Schedules/&#8230;2005.asp    If Christmas is a Tuesday, then just Tuesday is the holiday.   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A person was visiting to New York on the 29th December. She was planning to visit places such as the Statue of Liberty, State Island Ferry, Top of the Rock, Ground Zero, Central Park and Brooklyn Bridge. She needed a suggestion for a museum and other tourist attraction. She also wanted to know about the Boxing Day. Someone suggested her to visit MoMA museum and also informed her that there was no Boxing Day in USA.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person was coming to New York between 29/12 &#226;&#8364;&#8220; 3/1. She planned to visit essential sights and wonder would these places be opened on New Year Eve/Day. A commenter said every place the original poster mentioned will be opened on both New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. They also discussed US holidays which differ from UK.</Summary_2>

    <Body>     Hi there    We're off to new York in 11 days and my boyfriend is one of those who's holiday tradition is to buy smellies at the Duty Free. As we're going to New York, though, we'd ;like to know if it would be cost effective buying them in the Duty Free at Heathrow, Duty Free at JFK or in New York itself? He's looking for stuff like Farenheit 32 and Safari.    Any advice would be appreciated, thanks xx   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     I don't know much about Duty Free prices, but most visitors from the UK report that our local prices for  quot;smellies quot; (LOL, I love that!) are great bargains.    You can find great deals at the cosmetics counters at:    Century 21    Macy's    Filene's Basement    TJ Maxx    Sephora    And you can also try our local chain Perfumania.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     who are you flying with?     you normally can check out the plane's duty free prices online, or even the duty free in the airport online, so you know what the price is.     you can then go onto a website like macy's, or any of the other suggestions already, if they have a website, and have a quick glance at prices there, and find out which is cheaper..   </Owner>

      <Owner>     For Safari, you have to go to the DFF amp;Co Store - it's the Lancome/Ralph Lauren company store, which is open to the public. You can get 40-50% off retail prices. I know they have had Safari in the past (although because it's a company store, you can't guarantee what they will have at any particular time). It's on the 2nd floor of the office building on the southeast corner of 47th and 5th.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     The best deal for some perfumes/aftershave (different brands to the ones you mention) we bought on a recent trip were in the duty free shop at JFK - the price was the same as in the major stores including Sephora but there was no tax to pay, and 10% discount if you bought two or more items.    We also got a good deal on some at a place called Bazaar perfumes on 7th Ave near Times sq. We effectively haggled for it - undecided, we chose to leave it, but the guy offered it to us at a heavy discount that was too good to refuse.    You may however get a better deal at one of stores others have mentioned. You can get a 10% visitor discount card in Bloomingldales and Macys too - take ID to customer services.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     If you go to Macy's or one of the other large department stores, check to see if there's a promotion going on. There might be a 'free gift' included with the sale of the cologne...soap, lotion, deodorant, etc.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I can confirm the advice about freebies at the large department stores. I went to Bloomingdale's to buy some Vera Wang (?) perfume for my daughter.    For agreeing to buy the more expensive gift set, (only $10 difference) I was rewarded with a goodie bag full of freebies - scented candles, samplers, a silver photo frame etc. I was a hero when I returned.    Of course it could have been down to my natural charm and good looks :-)   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>Buying aftershave/perfume The blog is about buying aftershave/perfume of brands such as smellies, farenheit 32 and safari from duty free airport shops and from different stores in new york. Brands like smellies have great bargains in Macys stores. Perfumania-national chain and Cosmetics show can be a good place to check out. Safari brand perfume can be purchased from DFF &amp; Co store which belongs to Lancome/Ralph Lauren company store which can give you at 40-50% off retail prices. Duty free shop at JFK offers good prices for perfumes/aftershave. Their prices are same compare to major stores like Sephora, Bazaar perfumes, Bloomingdales and Macys. Macys is one of the largest department store and they might offer 'free gift' which include sale of the cologne, soap, lotion deodorant.  Bloomingdale store offers freebies such as scented candles, samplers, silver photo frame etc on purchasing expensive gift set.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person wanted to know where is the most cost-effective place to buy aftershave/perfume--Duty Free at Heathrow, Duty Free at JFK, or in New York itself. The answers were mixed. Different stores in New York were suggested. Large department stores such as Macy's offer promotions which often include free gifts. Although a person mentioned that for some brands, duty free shop at JFK offers better deals because of tax exemption and discounts.</Summary_2>

Russ and Daughters' Appetizing (smoked fish, smoked fish and more smoked fish! Take out, no seating.)    Il Laboratorio del Gelato, Cones, Chinatown Ice Cream Factory or Sundaes  amp; Cones (crazy and delicious frozen dairy scoopers)    Max Brenner's Chocolate (there are plenty of amazing chocolatiers in NYC, but Max Brenner's is the only sit-down restaurant.)    le Pain Quotidien (bread-focused cafe)    You could also take a Foods of NY tour or Brooklyn Pizza tour, which provide sightseeing with eating.    http://www.asliceofbrooklyn.com/    http://www.foodsofny.com/    But, as was said, the more specifics you can give us, the better we can help you.

      <Owner>     Lots of things to do in Brooklyn for first timers, third timers or old timers. Most of it will fit well within a tight budget. Here are some ideas, as well as food options:    DUMBO: Industrial architecture, cobblestone streets, softened by a waterfront park with amazing views of the city. Lots of art galleries with DAC and Smackmellon on Washington St. and about a dozen at 111 Front Street. For a meal head to Almondine, a tiny hole in the wall patisserie. Or, for a snack go to Jacques Torres Chocolates, both are on Water Street.    Brighton Beach: Been to Russia? This is a huge Russian neighborhood that will leave you feeling as if you left the USA. Wander up and down Brighton Beach Ave checking out the stores. A must is M amp;I International, an amazing food store. Wander the Boardwalk to Coney Island. To eat you can visit Cafe Glechic on Coney Island Ave about two blocks from Brighton, you can take out at M amp;I and eat on the boardwalk, or you can wait till Coney Island and go to Nathans Famous.    Park Slope: Get some culcha in ya. Grand Army Plaza is the fulcrum of culture in Brooklyn. Up Eastern Parkway is the Brooklyn Museum and the Botanic Gardens [great in any season]. Prospect Park is there as well. BAM is down Flatbush Ave and has a great cafe that's has lots of free performances. Park Slope extends from the Park down the hill. 7th and 5th are the main shopping streets. Lots of good eats. For a small bite and a place to relax, head to the Tea Lounge [Union  amp;7] or Ozzies [5  amp; Carroll]. Too many affordable restaurants to name on 5th Ave.    Williamsburg. A nabe famous for its pubcrawling and nightlife. Go on a Friday nite and hit the Brooklyn Brewery. You can get both great beer and filling German food at Radegast Hall [N3  amp; Berry]. BBQ is served at BKLYNs own roadhouse, Fette Sau [Metropolitan and N4]. Grab a burger and a shake at Dumont Burger [Bedford and S2 or S3]    As they said the other night in  quot;Bored to Death quot; -  quot;Brooklyn is the new Manhattan, Manhattan is the new Queens, and Queens is the new Brooklyn. quot;    See ya around the neighborhood.   </Owner>

    <Body>     Ahhhhhh! I am so excited. I am planning to make my first trip to NYC this December. I will be rewarding myself for losing 60 pounds - I have been dying to visit the big apple for as long as I can remember and have used that as my motivation to get myself healthy....finally that is DONE!    NOW, I am struggling with the trip. First, this southern girl is not used to the cold weather. Will I be miserable in December?    Second, I have built this trip up so much and I don't even know where to start, please send your absolute  quot;must do's quot; for a long weekend trip.    I will be staying in Astoria with a good friend.    THANKS ALL!!!   </Body>

      <Owner>     I grew up in Houston and live in NJ now, so maybe I can provide some perspective on the weather. If you look in the list of top questions (on the right side of the NYC forum page), the 5th question is about weather. If you click on it, you'll get a table that shows the average high and low temperatures by month. For December, the average low is 32F and the average high is 42F. That's within the range of what you probably experience at some point ever winter in Louisiana.    If you're sightseeing, you might be moving from the cold outdoors to heated (or often overheated) spaces indoors repeatedly throughout the day. The typical advice for dealing with such conditions -- dress in layers, etc. -- applies. Also, consider the possibility that you might encounter some snow (not necessarily likely, but possible). You'll want a pair of boots just in case -- and they really should be waterproof, because the slushy puddles that form as the snow melts are often a bigger problem than the snow itself.    What you should see while you're in NYC really depends on your interests, but don't let the cold weather stop you (unless you had your heart set on swimming the East River). If you get cold, stop for coffee / tea along the way and warm up.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     For show recommendations---- go on www.broadwaybox.com and read the synopsis of each show... some are discounted some are not.... Have you seen anything at all in the theater and do you like plays or musicals... If you have seen something what did you like and what did you not like.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Off Broadway Fuerza Bruta is an amazing show that is perfect for teens. Dazzling lights, audience participation, anger management, it's just amazing:    www.youtube.com/watch?v=taBAtxasWto    Another great thing about this show is that the theater is in Union Square. Great place to come to after the show. The Heartland Brewery or Blue Water Grill are great places to eat. After dinner, hang out in the Square and watch New York go by.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I highly recommend Toxic Avenger and Avenue Q. Lots of teen-tacky humor, but fun for adults, too! If they like South Park, they'll love these!! (And you'll be sooo cooooool!)    Both are playing at New World Stages on W. 50th Street, and are usually offered for discounts (either on line or at TKTS booths.)    Re: Rock of Ages - do they like 80's hair-band music? Or is it just you?    ;o)   </Owner>

    <Title>Help a native - food in JFK</Title>
    <Owner>BrooklynBrdge</Owner>
    <Body>     You'd think I'd know the answer to this question, but I just can't remember. I'm taking my husband on a super secret surprise trip to Miami next week for our anniversary. We're flying Delta out of JFK. I'm picking him up from the office and taking him straight to the airport, and since we won't land at MIA until 11PM (assuming everything goes on schedule - which would be miraculous), we'll want to eat before we get on the plane. I seem to recall that Delta flies out of terminals 2 and 3 at JFK, but it's been a while so I could be wrong. Anyone know where and whether there's food at JFK in the Delta domestic departures terminal? Before security, after security, or are there only chips and tic tacs at Hudson News by the gates?     TIA!   </Body>

I know this is off-topic, and you know him a little better than I do, but what happens if he has prepared a top-secret and expensive anniversary excursion for you as well?

      <Owner>     It's a fair question HankShanker, but it is only because I am absolutely certain that my husband will love exactly this trip at exactly this time - AND will enjoy the surprise of it - that I'm doing this. He knows that I would absolutely hate the same kind of surprise. And I have enrolled a number of his friends in the effort to make  quot;fake plans quot; with us throughout the weekend to ensure that he isn't planning something similar for me. Which he wouldn't do. Because I'd hate it. :)     So, yeah, it's really just a personality thing. But I trust my judgement of my husband's personality, and I expect that he'll be not just pleased, but blown away.   </Owner>

    <Title>Parents visiting - what do do w/ them on a rainy wknd?</Title>
    <Owner>karlab</Owner>
    <Body>     Hi,   My parents are coming to visit this weekend, of course they picked the coldest, rainest weekend we have had this year!  I have no idea what to do with them, I have lived in NYC for a while and nothing is coming to me besides going to the Met. Any locals have any suggestions on what to do?   My dad wanted to do the statue of liberty/ellis island, but I don't think the weather will be conducive to that trip. On Friday night we are going to see God of Carnage, so we already have a show to attend.  Thanks!   </Body>

      <Owner>     Don't know how old your parents are but do you think they would enjoy the Rock and Roll hall of fame annex in Soho---- they have a great exhibit on John Lennon and the Beatles..... If your parents are in their 60's it should be of real interest to them.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I would steer clear of the Met; it's crowded on weekends anyway and will be even more congested because of the rainy weather. But there are many other museums -- here is a roster from NewYorklogy of the hot links to the museums' own web sites for your convenience:  newyorkology.com/archives/2006/02/new_york_c&#8230;  Several museums which I think are terrific but are off the radar screens of most tourists like your parents:   ** the New York Historical Society (next door to the American Museum of Natural History) -- the  quot;Slavery in New York quot; permanent exhibition is unique and really well done;  quot;Lincoln in New York quot; is the showpiece of the special exhibitions currently on view.  http://www.lincolnandnewyork.org  https://www.nyhistory.org    ** the Rubin Museum, on W. 17th Street -- a jewel of a museum and more expansive in its offerings than its mission statement re: Himalayan art might suggest. Great little gift shop and an airy cafe with a rather off-beat  amp; tasty menu -- or you could head over to the Chelsea Market for lunch, although that too is apt to be zoo-y on a rainy weekend, so I'd make it an early or late lunch.   http://www.rmanyc.org/nav/about    ** the Transit Museum in downtown Brooklyn. It's much better, more interesting than the MTA's lame web site for it! A terrific gift shop for NYC souvenirs  http://mta.info/mta/museum/index.html#general  yelp.com/biz/new-york-transit-museum-brooklyn    How about doing one of the Harbor cruises? Those bring you up close to the Statue of Liberty, but you'll be under cover, and since it's unlikely to be foggy, you all will still get good views of the Manhattan skyline, etc. Sign up with Goldstar.com (it's free) and see if they still have 1/2 price tix for the Water Taxi's Statue of Liberty Express cruise or the Circle Line's Zephyr cruise (Goldstar also usually has great prices on the Rock  amp; Roll Hall of Fame Annex admission). Alternatively, use this coupon for a 90-minute cruise with NY Waterway: buy 1 ticket and get the 2nd ticket at 1/2 price:  destinationcoupons.com/new_york/&#8230;cruises.asp   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Why not Ellis Island? It is indoors and you can spend a good part of the day there.    Afterwards, if time allows, head over to the old Customs House and the Museum of the American Indian - the building alone is worth a visit and it is free.    I second the NY Transit Museum in Brooklyn.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Re: Outlet Shopping\Discount Shopping.    We've visited Woodbury Common several Times on our previous 5 visits. It's around a 1 hour drive by coach from the Port authority Bus terminal. Ticketc cost around &#163;40... it was 2 years since we last visited so it may have gone up. You'll have to factor the cost of traveling when thinking of the savings you may make.   Woodbury Common is HUGE!!, especially compared to any outlet malls in the UK. All the big names are there, Nike Adidas, Gucci, Channel, Under Armour Gap, Oakley, North Face... etc etc a Clothes Shoppers Paradise. The discounts are usually very good. Especially compared to UK prices. We found some great bargains in the North Face Store, saving nearly 80% on retail prices in the UK!!. CK, Armani and Diesel offered some similar bargains. It's definately worth a visit if your main aim is to shop till you drop...   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Actually, many of the locals would say a trip to Woodbury is not worth the time and expense unless you're looking for very high end designer labels like Gucci, Prada, Chanel etc. which are hard to find at discount anywhere else. For regular moderate priced designers or basic clothing, you might just as well look at the discount stores in Manhattan (Loehmann's, Daffy's, Century 21 etc.) and serve yourselves the time and trouble of the trip. The regular stores are also always having sales to move stock in this recession. Dept. stores like Macy's and Bloomingdales offer visitors an 11% discount if you register at the service desk before shopping with proof you don't live here (driver's license is fine).     Have no idea what you're referring to with Delta. Perhaps it's an issue with where their terminal is located? In what context are these mentions? Can you provide a link?   </Owner>

      <Owner>     It was in the context of whether to take Airtrain or a cab from the airport. I mentioned how long the cab line is when you arrive at the Delta terminal late at night. The roadway under the terminal is narrow and the taxi dispatcher is an idiot. The cab drivers tell me they're sitting in a lot waiting for the dispatcher to call them to the terminal when there is a long line... The last time I landed there I actually begged the guy to call the lot and he refused! Meanwhile, black cars line up to illegally solicit rides, blocking the few cabs who want to get through. Its a mess and my comment was to always do Airtrain when possible.    I fly Delta a lot, by choice - because they let you prebook exit rows, fly to where I'm going and are usually reasonably priced. This past year, I've pretty much flown Delta and Jet Blue exclusively.... The only time Delta is bad is if you have to go via Atlanta and the flights change giving you 40 minutes to transit there.   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>One person who was coming to JFK through a delta airlines plane has read previously some advice about arriving at JFK by delta airlines but did not remember in what context the advice was offered. The original poster who had offered the advice then clarified that it was regarding whether to take airtrain or cab from the airport. He suggested to take the airtrain since the taxi and roadway situation under the delta terminal is horrible. The original poster then asked another question about whether it is worth going to outlet mall. In response, many posters agreed that it might be better to look at discount stores in manhattan for moderate priced clothing.</Summary_1>

A few people agreed that for moderate priced clothing it might be better to look at discount stores in Manhattan.</Summary_2>

    <Title>Statue of Liberty with NY Pass</Title>
    <Owner>Likweed</Owner>
    <Body>     We're planning on getting a 7-day NY Pass. So the ferry to Liberty and Ellis are free, but there's no Crown or Monument-access included in the NY pass.    We'd like to get into the crown, so is there any possibility of doing that without reserving on the website of SoL and paying 15$ for Crown access (12$ for the ferry wich is already included in the NY Pass and 3$ for crown access)   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     The crown access is sold out months in advance and can only be gotten through the official web site.... With the passes you have you are going to have long wait. If you have not ordered the passes yet I would not do so, especially the 7 day one... It is overpriced and the admission info they tell you about not  accurate. For most people it is not the way to go   </Owner>

      <Owner>     What do you mean we'll have a long wait? I thought we could skip the ticket line and get straight in the (very long) waiting line?    This is what it says on the website:   quot;Free round-trip ferry ticket. New York Pass allows you to skip the ticket purchase line by presenting your Pass at the Eastern National bookstore inside Castle Clinton National Monument to receive your ticket for the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island ferry. quot;    We haven't ordered them yet and if I have my full  quot;intinerary quot; I'll see wath would be cheaper. But the biggest plus about the NY Pass to me was that we could skip some lines and save some time. (ESB,TotR)   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Most people who go to the statue have timed tickets for the boat... everyone else gets in line.... the last person who wrote about the NY PAss said they were not able to skip any lines and if you are not going to have a monument pass there is really not much reason to go to the island... Others who have been watching this will chime in . I would not rely on NY PAss to give you the information because they are trying to sell you something... I would look at the official statecruises web site and see what they say about people with this pass. The longer line at ESB is through security not the ticket line and I don't think you can skip that one either. I know on those passes they list the fee to enter the Met Museum as $20 when in fact it is always pay what you wish and many other places they list have free days..  The real danger of the passes is that people become slaves to it and feel they have to make back their investment. That is not the best way to see the city.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     If it helps you out the only real lines that people talk about are the SOL and ESB. The other places rarely have lines.... I also would not get a timed ticket for the ESB because it is so weather dependent... You don't want to go up there unless it is a clear day/// like today for instance is cloudy and rainy and it would be a waste of time.... For those kinds of sights you can always go to Top of the Rock where there rarely is a line.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     We recently did this with the NY pass. The queue you can avoid is the one to buy tickets, NY pass holders get their tickets from the bookstore inside Clinton monument. We got ours the day before, got up early the next day and got on the first ferry at 8:30 am. We went into the monument on our ticket, didn't have to buy anything extra.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     elevonic--- Once you got your ticket were you just meshed in with those that held time tickets for 8:30 or was there a separate line ? This time of year is not as crowded as the summer but I was wondering how they handled that.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     bilmin - the time I got there we were the first ones there! So don't know if there was another line at all, although I suspect there wasn't. The only advantage I could see with the NY pass was if there was a queue to buy your actual ticket, not queue for the security check etc.   </Owner>

    <Title>4 days in NYC, how much time do l need to see these sights?</Title>
    <Owner>Belly1505</Owner>
    <Body>     My boyfriend and l are in New York over New Years and only have 4 full days to try and squeeze things in! We would like to fit in the following things but l don't know how much time we need for each? Also the 4 days are the 30th Dec -2nd Jan so it's likely we will be pretty useless on the 1st!    Central Park  Top of the Rock  Brooklyn Bridge  Liberty Island - ferry and statue or just ferry [how long for each and is it worth going up or just seeing from ferry?]  Ground Zero  Shopping - essential for us Brits especially as the sales will be on!  Musuem of Modern Art [if we have time]    I was thinking Central Park and Brooklyn Bridge would probably be best for the 1st as it's just walking and the fresh air will probably help!? And perhaps the 2nd for shopping - will the shops be a lot busier as it is a Saturday or are they always the same at the time of year?    I am not sure which things to group together on which days and what days will be busier etc. Any help would be most appreciated! Many thanks    Oh also - we fly out of Newark at 8am on the Sunday, we are staying in Chelsea. How long should we allow to get to the airport [l was thinking a taxi would probably be the best option]? If we leave at say 5am will an hour be sufficient to get there?   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     As a tourist I found it best to group things together geographically instead of jumping all over the place.     Visit Liberty Island, Ground Zero, and walk the Brooklyn Bridge the same day. (BTW, I thought Ellis Island was more interesting than the Statue.)    Another day visit Central Park, MOMA, and TOTR. Fill in your extra time with shopping.    The NY experts will have to advise you on how to best fit your visit around New Years Day.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Walk the Brooklyn Bridge and consider passing either DUMBO or Brooklyn Heights on the other side. Either walk back or take the subway back to Manhattan. Ground Zero, Wall Street, and the South Street Seaport are nearby. So is Chinatown and Little Italy. Liberty Island is nice but includes a very long line. YOu may want to simply pass the Statue on the Staen Island Ferry instead. All of this can be done in one day.    Next day group Central Park, either the Metroploitan Museum of Art or MOMA, St Patrick's, Rockefeller Center amp; Top of the Rock, and TImes Square.    Next day you may want to go way uptown to the Cloisters which is a great, peaceful spot with a medieval museum. Then Grant's Tomb, Riverside Church, and the Cathedral of St John the DIvine (largest Gothic Cathedral in the World).    Next day explore the Village or consider a Hudson river cruise.    All of the things you mentioned can easily be done in 4 days.   </Owner>

Things always sound better on paper than they really are----If it is in the ballroom there are probably no windows. You do get one point though for going there instead of the Olive Garden which is across the street. Also having been there once I would not be too sure about the  quot;designated area quot; for the ball drop. Perhaps someone has done this before and can fill in the blanks   </Owner>

It is a once in a lifetime experience but be prepared to be flexible if things don't go exactly as planned.

I also agree that being with another couple or two would make it more festive, but otherwise, esp. as you're right in the hotel, I'd go for it. Just go with moderate (and low) expectations and you're likely to be pleasantly surrised.   </Owner>

Might see 25% off come out first but you can afford to wait for better as there will be discount tickets available at tkts day of the show.

      <Owner>     I received an early invitation to buy tickets last month. Non-peak shows are listed at 11 am. 2,5 and 8pm for Dec 15-16. Same shows are non-peak on the 17th with the exception of 8pm show which is peak show as are all other shows till the end of Dec. You probably would not have a problem waiting to buy tickets if you are flexible and go to a day-time non-peak show. If you want to go 18th, 19th or 20th I would buy now. I usually attend the second week of Dec., there is always empty seats here and there. I splurge and buy good seats, you want to be on the first level, I tried the second mezz and nope, not the same. Orch/1st mezz are $105. Non-peak orch/1st mezz are $75. Premium tickets avail too, but the Orch/1st mezz have been great. My offer was buy one ticket get one free. But only for non-peak shows Nov 13-25 and the 30th. code DMBOGO purchase before 10/30.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Waiting is definitely the best thing to do for cheaper, better seats. This is a large venue and they put on as many as 3 shows per day.     Weekday and morning / early afternoon performances are probably better for discounts. We went to a Tuesday 11:00 am show ( Dec 16 ) the week before 25th holiday.    Here is what I experienced. Premium tickets were going for $90 each in November. In early Dec prices for same seats were lowered to ~$70. Soon after that they offered 2 for the price of one, so we had 4 very good seats for just ~$150.    And there were still a lot of empty seats in the theatre.   </Owner>

Soups, sandwiches type of food would be great as we would like time to walk around the financial district and Law Courts in that 2/3 hours    I've looked on yelp, menu pages etc but still can't make up my mind.   </Body>

      <Owner>     nywhiz, we will be arriving on Thursday evening. I know that its a lottery where the weather is concerned but weather permitting we would prefer somewhere we could sit outside to eat so we can take in the atmosphere of the area, plus I love watching people in unfamiliar places go about their business.    Poppa, I know there's plenty of places to choose from but I was just hoping that maybe someone who lives/works in the area might have a particular recommendation. I usually try and get a couple of recommendations as its all too easy when you're hungry to dive into the nearest reasonable looking place only to be disappointed with the food.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     PJ Clarke's in the World Financial Center has some outdoor tables overlooking the marina but I doubt it will be warm enough to sit outside. Gigino's in Wagner Park is an Italian place with views of the SOL but service (and food) is uneven. There are quite a few restaurants inside the World Financial Center. You could even get some food and take it out and eat on a bench overlooking the water.    I've never been but Liberty View is a Chinese/Thai restaurant that looks like a nice option too with lunch specials and a nice view from inside.  www.menupages.com/restaurants/liberty-view/   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I've had lovely lunches at Gigino's but here's another suggestion, for takeaway food: the Amish Fine Foods market at 17 Battery Place, right across the street from the northern edge of Battery Park. I have no idea why they call themselves  quot;Amish quot; -- the owners are Turkish, and there is no apple butter, chow-chow relish or shoofly pie in the place. But it's a cornucopia of all kinds of foods, with something for everyone. And the Battery Park City Parks Conservancy's esplanade along the Hudson River offers any number of places to enjoy its landscaped plantings and public art.  http://www.amishfinefood.com/apa01.php?id=2  http://www.bpcparks.org/bpcp/parks/parks.php    While you're in the area, do visit the Irish Hunger Memorial, across the street from the Embassy Suites hotel adjacent to the northwest edge of the World Financial Center.  inetours.com/New_York/Pages/Irish_Hunger.html  newyorkcitywalk.com/html/images_IrishFamine.&#8230;    If your feet grow weary, take advantage of the free shuttle service throughout lower Manhattan offered by the Downtown Alliance:  www.downtownny.com/gettingaround/?sid=19  downtownny.com/images/&#8230;route_map.html   </Owner>

    <Title>Chaming Northeast Town: Which One to Visit?</Title>
    <Owner>kayeen</Owner>
    <Body>     We are thinking of taking a weekend getaway at the end of the month. Thought we would explore some of our own backyard, but have to admit we have no clue about our own backyard (shame on us!). We are hoping that we might get some suggestions on where we can go. We would prefer to be able to train or bus back and forth to the village/town/city. Any suggestions on a nice quaint place in the northeast area for an overnight or two nite visit?   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     It's always a challenge to find  quot;quaint and charming quot; that's on a train line or bus route and also has enough to keep you interested within walking distance.    Rhinebeck, NY is one popular option. The train station is Rhinecliff (Metro North) with a short taxi ride into Rhinebeck where there are a few hotels/inns and some restaurants.    Here are the Metro North one day getaways which can certainly be done for 2 days (although the train ticket price may be different). There are also some new overnights listed including the Philip Glass house in Ct.  http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/outbound.htm    If you're into antiques, the town of Hudson, NY has a lot to offer (on the train line).   </Owner>

      <Owner>     How about Saratoga Springs? It won't be as lively at the end of October as in the summer when the Racetrack is open  amp; the Philadelphia Orchestra and the New York City Ballet are in residence, but it's a charming college town (Skidmore) with a variety of shops, good restaurants and accommodations -- and the State Park with its variety of mineral springs (do a tasting tour!). And prices won't be as high as in July-August.  http://www.discoversaratoga.org   http://www.saratoga.org/visitors/    Amtrak will get you to Saratoga Springs in 3-1/2 hours.

      <Owner>     Here is a second vote for Rhinebeck---- there is a nice hotel in the downtown area called the Beekman Arms.... While I would prefer to see you drive to visit some of the many wineries in the area if you must take the train there is enough in the downtown area to keep you busy for a weekend and the in town location of the Beekman Arms will be ideal for just walking around.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Yes ..... Rhinebeck is wonderful ..... and that's why I'll bet you a hundred bucks the Beekman Arms is totally booked.   For something a bit closer you might try Cold Spring. It's right on the Hudson line of the Metro North. You might still find some rooms there.   Or ..... the Mohonk Mountain House in new Paltz is pretty big and you might ..... just might ..... still find a room there too.   </Owner>

Well the thing is I bought a pair of shoes the other day, no lace type, and for the first time ever I have required the need for a shoe horn. I'm quite easily pleased. I purchased one at a store in my home town, but its quite boring and plain, so I am hoping as the trump is the next big hotel I am staying at will have one with their emblem on it.     p.s. I am not planning on taking the said shoes to NYC!!! ha ha   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Perhaps we should alert the Trump organization that one of the members of the notorious shoe horn swipers is planning their next heist in NYC.  Is INTERPOL still in existence?  You know a shoe horn with a logo works much better than a plain old generic model!  Perhaps a carefully worded inquiry to the hotel would be in order from the OP.  As long as it doesn't tip them off!  This is really amusing..........at least he/she doesn't want to know who's buried in Grant's tomb.  Poppa   </Owner>

    <Title>Trip Report - Oct 10-14</Title>
    <Owner>CaptainOver</Owner>
    <Body>     Day 1 - arrived early on a red eye. Thankfully the Thompson LES gave us our room at 6:30 a.m. They really didn't have to do this: we had an amazing rate at $167/night for a King studio suite, and I really should have booked the extra night to ensure the early access.    After a short nap, we hit the streets and walked around the LES and Soho. We had a late lunch at White Slab Palace...a funky joint on the LES with a Scandinavian theme. (recommended!)     We grabbed a pre-dinner drink at The Back Room, a speakeasy/prohibition themed bar with complicated access and drinks served in teacups. Then we had dinner at the hotel restaurant Shang to claim our $100 dinner credit (part of the amazing hotel deal). Great food....great service. Then up to the hotel, semi-private club Above Allen for after dinner drinks.    Day 2 - Slept in....first activity was brunch at Tavern on the Green (admittedly this was a lapse in judgment....marginal food...marginal service...way overpriced for the value...but I wanted my wife to see it before it closed and to buy a present for a friend).    After brunch, walked over to Lincoln Center to see South Pacific....very enjoyable.     We had dinner at Mercer Kitchen....good food, decent service, but not exceptionally memorable.     Day 3 - Took the subway up to mid-town to walk around and check out the stores. Ate lunch at Aquavit Cafe (very good, recommended). Did more walking around mid-town....then went back to the hotel to change before going back up for dinner at Nobu 57 (excellent food, superior service!).    Hit the subway back to the LES to a reservation at Milk  amp; Honey (small bar that focuses on specialty drinks). Very enjoyable; I would definitely go back.     Then we walked over to Arlene's Grocery to check out karaoke night (very entertaining).     Day 4 - Lunch at Macelleria in the Meatpacking District. (very tasty) Walked around a bit, checked out The Standard and some of the shops before heading uptown. It was pretty chilly by the water. Went downtown (my wife wanted to check out Century 21 and Ground Zero)...then up to Greenwich Village for great, but expensive gelato at Grom.    We ate dinner at Allen  amp; Delancey (very nice....recommended) and then used a car service for a few hours to go bar hopping: Double Crown, a bar upstairs from 675 bar (although we intended to go to 675), Crif Dogs/PDT - fun! and back to the LES for a nightcap.    Day 5 (partial day) - just walked around the LES and Soho before having late lunch at Whole Foods. Car picked us up for JFK at 4 p.m.    Al in all...a wonderful trip.   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Excellent report. We're planning a remarkably similar sort of trip for the beginning of November - laid back, lots of food and interesting drinks. We couldn't make our way into Milk and Honey last year - glad you enjoyed it. We had a great time at Pegu Club instead. Hopefully we can make Milk and Honey this time around.     Cheers,   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thank you. The trick to M amp;H was that we went on a Monday night. I think that's the only way to get the 10:30 reservation time that we were able to get. Otherwise, we would have had to try for a much earlier time. Also, I made the request exactly one month ahead...which probably helped as well.    Good luck on your next trip.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     You may be too early for baseball. I think it will start the week after you are here. If you are staying on W46th there are 25 restaurants on that street between 8th and 9th ave and hundreds more on 9th itself.    www.restaurantrownyc.com   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Being that you are not coming in until April, you have lots of time to do the research about New York. Browse the guidebooks and use the Forums for more pointed questions, rather than for blanket advice. For food, check out web pages such as:    www.yelp.com/nyc   www.menupages.com/  chowhound.chow.com/    As for the Yankees, you will likely have to see them at their spring training site in Tampa.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I disagree with Preston about that taxi. Unlike JFK, Newark airport is not in the state of New York, and the cab system is very different -- and that includes the cost. For your destination, I would prefer the train or the bus options described in the FAQs to the right of this page.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I think all of us in New York City really enjoy the enthusiasm and interest in the NYC forum that people from other parts of the world show in this forum however there are occasional posts that aren't always consistent with what we know to be best.    Super Shuttle is not a good option for getting in to New York City from Newark (or any of the NYC airports). The challenge with Super Shuttle is that they can't charge a rate that will allow them to make money so they have to fill the entire van in order to barely cover their costs. The reason for this is that the Olympia Trails bus and the AirTrain Newark / NJ Transit options are extremely fast and efficient at $15.00. As a result, Super Shuttle will take your money and make you wait forever until every seat is filled, then they'll stop at every hotel.    AirTrain Newark / NJ Transit will get you from inside the terminal to New York Penn Station in 45 minutes for $15.00. No traffic, no waiting outside in the cold. The Olympia Trails bus will get you from outside the terminal to Port Authority or Grand Central in 45 - 90 minutes (depending on traffic and which terminal you board, where you get off the bus). The bus is also $15.00 per person.    A prearranged ride with a reputable company like All State (www.allstatelimo.com) and Dial 7 (www.dial7.com) will set you back something in the ballpark of $60.00 if you do not select the meet and greet.    Please do not use Super Shuttle and do not use accept a ride from any of the touts asking whether you need a ride.   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A couple was visiting NYC on 3rd April for 4 nights/5 days. They wanted to know a cheapest or quickest way to reach Manhattan from Newark Airport. They also wanted information about places to eat, places to visit and yankees ticket.   Someone suggested that they were too early for baseball game and also suggest the website www.restaurantrownyc.com. They were suggested to check out yelp.com for food and take taxi from the airport.  Super Shuttle was another option to reach Manhattan from airport for $17 but that was not recommended. Prearranged ride service was available from the companies like All State and dial7.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person is looking for advice on the best way to get into Manhattan (W64th) from Newark Airport, whether cheapest or quickest, and also advice on places to eat and visit. This person also wants to see the Yankees, and asked where is the best place to buy tickets and how much they cost. For transporation, some people suggested taking a cab, while some other people suggested taking the bus or train. The bus and train option is said to be extremely fast and efficient at $15 per person, while the cab will cost around $60. Many people strongly recommended against Super Shuttle.  Someone pointed out that the baseball season started a week after the person's stay. As for restaurants, there are 25 restaurants on the street the person is staying and hundred more nearby, www.restaurantrownyc.com.</Summary_2>

    <Title>Which Hampton Inn?</Title>
    <Owner>Lynn3</Owner>
    <Body>     We're going to the Tribeca Film Center on a Saturday and are thinking of staying at either the Hampton Inn Chelsea or the Hampton Inn Seaport/Financial District. (Ruled out SoHo because beds are double not queen and we're a family of four.) Any thoughts on which location would be better, or any other hotel suggestions in or close to Tribeca?  Thanks,  Lynn   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Chelsea is much more lively in the evening. The Seaport location is rather dull on the off-season weekends. In the summer time there are lots of people out and about all over all the time. As we get into the Autumn months and winter, weekend evenings just aren't as exciting in that area.    Chelsea on the other hand has many more restaurants and you'll find much more  quot;locals oriented quot; pricing rather than the tourist oriented stuff around the Seaport.    Chelsea will also be much more convenient to Penn Station and you'll have more transportation options. There is always a lot of trackwork on the subways on the weekend and it disproportionably impacts Lower Manhattan / Financial District.    You might also enjoy walking over to Madison Square Park and going to Shake Shack.    A side note is that Chelsea is a diverse neighborhood and if you're offended by (or don't want your kids to see) the gay community, you may not like Chelsea. As long as you're happy with diversity, Chelsea is a great neighborhood. There is even a big Whole Foods on 7th Avenue and 24th Street.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Why single out gays -diversity is everywhere - the OP says they are from Philadelphia - I'll bet they have gays there!  We were in Provincetown, MA last weekend, that is about as gay as you can get and we saw many families with young children - as a matter of fact we took our 2 there starting when they were 6 and 8 and for several years after that - never seemed to affect them - not really sure how it would.  The reference to 'diversity' i.e. gays was certainly not called for.  Poppa   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Um, have you ever read any of my other posts?    Chelsea is one of my favorite neighborhoods to hang out in. I'm disappointed I wasn't able to make it to P-town this year, I haven't been in years. Fire Island is close and easy to reach. Just like P-town, the Pines and The Grove have also seen a large increase in families with children moving in.    Unfortunately there are the occasional visitors who don't appreciate the great diversity that is NYC. Yes, these folks here are from Philly and I'm sure they'll feel right at home but we do occasionally get visitors from farther afield who don't get it. There is a bar on West 46th Street (Restaurant Row) called The Ritz. Unsuspecting tourists walk in all the time and occasionally some get pretty freaked out when they realize,  quot;um, we ain't in Kansas no more! quot; Personally, my friends and I find it quite funny. Another reason I can't imagine living anywhere else.    So, that is why I mentioned it.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Do you mean you want to focus on Italian-American heritage sights in NYC? Well, if you fly into Fiorello LaGuardia airport, you're off to a good start. ;o)    Some must-see places for Italian-American history are:    Ellis Island    The Tenement Museum    www.tenement.org    Arthur Avenue in the Bronx    http://www.arthuravenue.com/index.jsp    I don' t know much about the Garibaldi-Meucci Museum, but it sounds interesting:    &#8230;andyswebtools.com/cgi-bin/p/awtp-home.cgi&#8230;    Mozart's Veneitian-born libretist, Lorenzo da Ponte was a professor of Italian at Columbia U. years after he wrote Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni.    columbia.edu/cu/&#8230;Beeson.html    You can skip Little Italy in Manhattan. It's actually  quot;Microscopic Italy quot; - it's 4 blocks long with over-priced, mediocre touristy restaurants. I've never been to the Italian American Museum on Mulberry Street, but youan check it out:    italianamericanmuseum.org/news/ihcm_09.html    The two things that are still great in Little Italy are canollis at Ferrara's bakery and the Vietnamese noodle shops.   </Owner>

In warmer weather, you can eat al fresco at table streetside, with Italian music playing and front row seats to people watch the comings and goings! There are tons of good restuarants. Here's a link:  http://www.littleitalynyc.com/gethere.asp    Da Tomasso  Paeano's  Sorrento's  Il Cortile  are all favorites of mine! But go and find your own!

      <Owner>     Little Italy can be a tourist trap. It's crowded, the restaurants are overpriced and the area is shrinking more and more as Chinatown takes it over block by block. It's hard to say one wants an Italian experience in NYC because it's such a melting pot. It's great to come to NYC to explore many cultures of the people who live here. You can come and hear 10 different languages spoken in the streets every day. Italian history is all over the five boroughs. But, to be specific, you have Arthur Ave up in the Bronx, the Middle Village neighborhood of Queens, Bensonhurst and Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn. There is even an Italian American Heritage Museum on Mulberry St in Little Italy. Buon viaggio!   </Owner>

    <Title>Travel Time from Times Square to Brooklyn Tabernacle?</Title>

    <Body>     We will be staying at The Hotel @ Times Square and I would like to know how much time to allow to travel to Brooklyn Tabernacle on a Sunday morning.

Can you tell me what route would be the most direct? And are there any subway lines that typically don't run on Sundays that I need to be aware of?    Thanks!   </Body>

      <Owner>     Your hotel isn't really in Times Square but it is right around the corner from the 47th-50th St/Rockefeller station for the B, D, F,  amp; V subway lines. I'd take the F train to its Jay St./Borough Hall location; the Tabernacle will be just steps away.  http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/fline.htm    To find out what impact subway repairs might be having on operations that weekend, check the MTA's service advisories page; you can even sign up to have the MTA send you e-mail or text message alerts  &#8230;mta.info/NewTP/&#8230;ServiceAdvisoryAll.aspx   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A person would be staying at the Hotel at the Times Square and would like to know the time to travel to Brooklyn Tabernacle on a Sunday morning. He needed information about the most direct route.  He was suggested to take the B, D, F &amp; V train from the 47th-50th St/Rockefeller station and also to check the impact of subway repairs. The actual train ride was scheduled to be 20 minutes.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person wanted to know the most direct route and travel time for subway from Times Square to Brooklyn Tabernacle. People suggested to take the F train to Jay St./Borough Hall station. The train ride itself is about 20 minutes. The original poster planned for 45 minutes to account for walking and waiting for the train.</Summary_2>

      <Owner>     There aren't too many other places with a view. One if By Land is very romantic, no view but it's in an old carriage house in Greenwich Village. Roaring fire, piano, etc. I was disappointed with the food, however.     The View is the revolving restaurant at the top of the Marriot Marquis. I think it's overpriced but you could go there for a drink or dessert to get your view.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     We had a very good meal at the Boathouse in Central Park, we went for Sunday brunch, lovely setting. Probably not so good for evening, locals can let you know.  We enjoyed The View, but atmostphere not very special for a romantic dinner.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     It's rare to get a combination of a view AND good food. Honestly, I would sacrifice the view for dinner: you'll have plenty of other opportuinities to see the city, and wouldn't you rather focus on looking at your partner for your anniversary? You could take a trip up the ESB or across the Brooklyn Bridge AFTER dinner if you really want a view to be a part of your evening.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     *** We were looking for a good mix of great view, romantic, and good food for our anniversary dinner ***    Okay .... similar to the River Cafe is the 'Water's Edge' in LIC. It also sits right on the water with a pretty nice view of the 59th Street Bridge and midtown Manhattan (Empire State Bldg., Chrysler Bldg. and UN). The surrounding area in LIC is not as nice as B'klyn Heights but there used to be a private ferry that can take you across the East River from Manhattan right to the restaurant dock.   The property was just bought by an Asian restaurant group but I think I read they also bought the ferry boat. The whole restaurant has just been renovated after the sale, so I have not had a chance to see what the new owners did with the place. But the for food, view and romance ..... this might fit the bill.  http://www.watersedgenyc.com/   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Yep, I heard that Water's Edge changed hands and has improved. (I actually enjoyed my one dinner there about 10 years ago, and the view is great, so it seems like a good option.) I'm going to a wedding there in June.    I agree with BrooklynBrdge - focus on the food and atmo for dinner, enjoy the view later going to the top of the ESB or TOTR, or at a rooftop bar or even on the Staten Island Ferry.    Even the food is not the best, the atmo and view at Metrazur is stunning. It's located on the balcony of the main hall of Grand Central Terminal. Awesome!   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A couple was looking for a place for the anniversary dinner with great view, romantic and good food. The suggested places were Marriot Marquis, Boathouse in Central Park and Water's Edge in LIC. Someone gave them the roster of restaurants with notable views with hot links to their web sites and also suggest them to compare reviews on menupages.com, citysearch and Yelp to figure out final decision. They were suggested to take a trip up the ESB or across the Brookyln Bridge to get the great view after the dinner. Someone offered them the reservation transfer for Water's Edge for December 20.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person waited too long to get reservations at River Cafe, and was looking for suggestions for a place for anniversary dinner with a good mix of great view, romantic, and good food. Someone recommended One if By Land as romantic but no view and The View, which is a revolving restaurant at the top of the Marriot Marquis. Although The View is overpriced, the person has recommended going in for a drink or dessert to get the view. Another person recommended the Boaathouse in Central Park, but pointed out that it may not be so good for evening. She also pointed out that the atmosphere at The View might not be very special for a romantic dinner. One person shared a link, which contains a roster of restaurants with notable views, and suggested comparing reviews on several other sites. Someone suggested Water Edge in LIC as similar to the River Cafe because it sits right on the water with a pretty nice view o f the 59th Street Bridge and midtown Manhattan (Empire State Bldg., Chrysler Bldg. and UN). Another suggestion was to focus on the food and atmosphere for dinner first and enjoy the view later by taking a trip up the Empire State Building or other places.</Summary_2>

      <Owner>     My mum and I have been to New York at Christmas time every year for the last 4 years and love it!    The Radio City Christmas Spectacular is great. It's aimed at kids but as long as you're young at heart you'll enjoy the story of Christmas. We've seen that 3 times now so this year we have opted for White Christmas at the Marquis theatre instead.     The rockefeller tree and ice rink is a must see and there are some nice restaurants overlooking the ice rink for dinner and lunch.     Central park is lovely in winter, one year it snowed when we were there and it just looked like a postcard.     if you go to see Grand Central Station there is a lovely Christmas Market in the Vanderbuilt Hall which is worth a visit.     And of course the window displays on 5th Avenue and Macys are great.     if you have any question, please get in touch.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     My personal must is a Staten Island Ferry ride in the early evening when it is just darks and the skyline buildings are lit up for Christmas.     If it is very cold, you can stay indoors and look out the windows, but you can also go out on deck. Bring some hot chocolate!    Also check out the Neopolitan christmas tree at Met Museum and consider a visit to the Cloisters, the Met's medieval art collection in Washington Heights which is decorated for Xmas,and sometimes has live holiday music.    Check out local churches for special (and quite lovely) holidays servicesand concerts. Worth it   </Owner>

      <Owner>     The Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn may be a bit of a schlep to get to, but the lights put the Rockefeller Center Tree to shame. To set the stage, this is a neighborhood of single family homes that compete to see who has the biggest and most outlandish decorations. We're talking life sized mechanical men, snow globes and enough electricity usage to power a small city. I know that there are tour buses that come here when the lights are happening. To get you psyched - check out this website [especially the photos].    &#8230;about.com/od/&#8230;dyker_heights02-jpg.htm   </Owner>

    <Title>Using subway to JFK</Title>
    <Owner>Peggysue45</Owner>
    <Body>     Is it  quot;doable quot; from Canal street Stn to Howard Beach-JFK with 3 medium to large pieces of luggage + hand luggage btw 2 adults  Propose to be on train around midday on Monday 3rd Jan. Memory of our last visit on subway was some very full trains at all hours or would best option be a cab.  Cheers   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     I guess it's doable, depending on your endurance, weight of the bags and so on. I don't think there's an elevator (only at the 6,4 train station on Canal) so you will need to manage the stairs. It may also be awkward getting through the ticket turnstiles with two cases (bad enough with one). If there's an MTA employee they may let you bypass the turnstiles.    It should be relatively uncrowded that time of day apart from people going for lunch. Luggage isn't unusual on the A train.    Personally I'd take a cab or car service such as Carmel (not so much for myself but my wife would hate a subway ride with bags, she just tolerates it without).   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I've gone away for two weeks and taken quite a bit of stuff and I've always taken either the A or the E train to the AirTrain. For Canal Street the A is easier. For Midtown the E is easier. It always confuses people that if you're boarding an A and heading to the airport you're going downtown. If you're boarding an E train and heading to the airport you're uptown.    You want an A train in the downtown / Brooklyn direction.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     It'll take about 45 minutes in a taxi and it will be $45.00 plus toll and tip. I'd have the driver take the Williamsburg Bridge - No Toll! If you take the WillyB (sorry, that is just what we call the Williamsburg Bridge) - figure $55.00 USD.    It shouldn't take more than 45 minutes but it doesn't hurt to allow an hour.    Keep in mind you'd be fine with the subway but if you're not comfortable with the stairs then the taxi is your best bet. Have fun and enjoy. We're here if you have any additional questions.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Notice, by the way, that the sports arena is not called  quot;Madison Square. quot; It is instead called  quot;Madison Square Garden quot;. If you want to shorten that, then say  quot;the Garden quot;, but do not just say  quot;Madison Square. quot; Madison Square certainly exists, but it is not a sports arena. It is instead a public square between Fifth and Madison avenues running north from 23rd Street. The original Madison Square Garden was located near there, but subsequent versions of the Garden have been as much as two miles away, and so one needs to be careful about the correct nomenclature. Asking for directions to  quot;Madison Square quot; will get you instructions on how to get to the park at Madison Avenue and 23rd Street, where you can get a burger at the Shake Shack. Asking for directions to Madison Square Garden, on the other hand, will get you directions to the sports arena that sits on top of Pennsylvania station between 31st and 33rd Street, and fronting on Eighth Avenue.   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A person wanted to attend a basketball game in Madison Square garden so needed suggestions whether to book tickets in advance or to buy it after arriving in NYC. He was suggested that he can buy tickets from the NY knicks website and can also pick up tickets from the window. Someone also suggested him that the sport arena was Madison Square Garden and not Madison square so be careful while asking for directions.</Summary_1>

      <Owner>        Taxi will probably cost about $30 from LGA depending   on what time of day. I live in Brooklyn and had   never heard of this place but more and more are   popping up every day. If you are committed to this   place call the Innkeeper and ask her for a recommendation for a car service (limo) it might end up   being cheaper in case you are caught in traffic near   LGA.Trips from LGA to Brooklyn are on the meter as   opposed to Manhattan where it is a flat fee.   The location is ok but not really near anything.   I think there is a subway stop not too far and you   will probably want to check that out to find things   to do.    10th street at 4th avenue is not really what I   would call a happening place but again not a bad   neighborhood.   </Owner>

      <Owner>        Not at all. Brooklyn if it were a stand alone city   would be the 6th largest in the US in terms of area.   That person who put a note to look at the NYC forum   has been doing that for a long time and I don't    know why. By posting on the Brooklyn site you will   get much more focused responses. There are some in   Manhattan that probably have never been to Brooklyn.     Anyway, now that I know about your daughter, your   plan makes sense and you already know about the R   line. Just learn the subway and bus system and get   an unlimited card for the time you are here and   you will be fine.     I'll keep an eye out on this forum and if I can   answer any questions for you I will. Enjoy Brooklyn.            </Owner>

      <Owner>        Yes- take the R at 9th street heading towards Manhattan two stops to Atlantic Avenue-- switch to the  2 train heading away from Manhattan to Brooklyn Museum-  which is right at the Entrance to the BBG.. total  travel time about 15 minutes--     Ps: my daughter was married at the BBG- we love it   too.     At your first subway stop get a transit map and   use the maps on the wall at each station.. they will   prove invaluable.   </Owner>

    <Title>Trip to New York City In September 2009</Title>
    <Owner>oziboy</Owner>
    <Body>     Hi, I am from Sydney Australia and I am travelling to New York City in mid September (17/9/09) with my partner and mother in law. I know there are a lot of posts on here but just wanted to get a perspective for me on a few questions.      We will be flying from Las Vegas to New York on 17/9/09 can anyone suggest a good airline and which airport to land at in NY.      We are undecided where to stay...It appears the Manhattan area can be expensive for obvious reasons but was thinking about Long Island City or Brooklyn. We love a walk so distance isnt a problem but evening travel it would be nice to be near transport.       As you may have already picked up this is our first trip to New York. So it is a little confusing :)      Our budget is about $200 max a night per room as we would be needing 2 rooms unless someone can suggest accommodation with 2 rooms at a reasonable price.       We are open to many suggestions but want to get it sorted sooner than later.      We will be in LA for 5 nights then Las Vegas for 3 nights then to New York area for 10 nights...      Thanking you all advance.....      :)      </Body>

      <Owner>     Since it's your first visit, you should definitely stay in Manhattan. You can certainly find rates under $200. Go on Expedia, hotels.com, etc. They have rooms under your price range. Cross-check the hotels with the reviews here and book. There's no reason you should be staying in Brooklyn during the lowest NY hotel prices in the last 5 years. May I suggest the Comfort Inn Central Park West? I just did a search on Expedia for a random weekend in Sept and they have rooms for $150/night.    Good luck with your search.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     You're welcome, and I like that choice. It has great reviews here and you'll like the location. You are in the Murray Hill neighborhood close to NYU Medical Center. It is a primarily residential neighborhood of young professionals. If you want to see them all party, try Brother Jimmy's on 31st  amp; Lex. The 6 train will take you anywhere on the East side and you have a myriad of options to transfer to other trains since you are not far from Grand Central.    I'm not sure about Yankees tickets, but to get to Boston there are 3 ways: fly, rail or bus. Flying is not recommended with all the hassles you have to endure plus cab fare. Rail is pricey at $100+ per ticket. The bus is pretty good, you can find fares as low as $15 each way.    Google: Fung Wa bus; Mega Bus and Bolt bus in NYC. Any of those will serve your needs.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Oziboy,    The first thing I'd advise since this is your first visit to New York is to realize that the subway is the quickest, cheapest, and best way to get any where in the five boroughs. Rregarding airlines from Vegas, land in LaGuardia if possible. It is closer to Manhattan than JFK or LaGuardia.    Yankees vs Boston is usually a sell out. Good Luck.    You mention you like walks. NYC has some great ones. I'd suggest a walk over the Brookly Bridge and into Dumbo and Bklyn Heights. Also walk through Central Park. In Brooklyn visit Grand Army Plaza, Prospect Park, and the boardwalk and aquarium in Coney Island. Take a ride on the Staten Island Ferry. I can go on and on. You'll have a blast.    </Owner>

    <Title>Clinton Hills or do we do Manhattan?</Title>
    <Owner>KristyGrl</Owner>
    <Body>     Hello lovely people!    We have a group of 6 people (5 from Australia and one a Japanese resident) heading to New York in December for a week (we're going to a music festival that takes place over 3 days in Brookyln), all in our mid to late 20s.    We have found a great price on a 3 bedroom apartment in Clinton Hills. ($117 a night!)   Just wondering if anyone can tell us whether we are better off saving money by staying in Brooklyn and having a bit more room, or spending a bit more cash in Manhattan. Is the convenience of Manhattan worth an extra few couple hundred dollars each?    We're all pretty keen to do this as cheap as possible, but I'm thinking maybe it may be worth our while to spend a little more (if possible) and stay in the heart of the action, so to speak.    Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     First, make sure that the apartment you found is not a scam - many apartment rentals in NYC are.    As much as I love Brooklyn, I usually advise 1st time visitors to stay in Midtown Manhattan to get to know the island a little. But since you will be attending a festival, and the price sounds too good to be true (I'm extremely skeptical of this deal, please tell me you didn't find it on Craigslist) it will be more convenient for you to stay in Brooklyn. And in Manhattan will cost you probably 4 times as much for your number of people.    Good luck and let us know if the lodging works out - check ripoffreport.com or Google the company name, make sure there are no horror stories.    And pay with a credit card!   </Owner>

      <Owner>     nope, not on Craigslist.  It was on homeaway and from what I can see they appear to be legitimate (I have looked at several independant reviews of the site.)  The woman who is renting it out says that she is running a special and it's usually about an extra $50 a night from what I can tell.  It seemed a little too good to be true for me as well, but from the looks of homeaway at least legit (I have also looked the name of the person doing this rental up on the white pages and they do have a residence at that address which I feel is a positive sign - surely a scammer would have a fake address?) and homeaway also offers internet fraud protection up to $1000 (which is what we're being asked to pay)  That all SEEMS pretty good to me, but if there's anything I'm not thinking of, please let me know!  The festival is over three nights (four including an after party). We still want to see as much of NYC as possible, and saving the money on the accomodation will help us do that... unless of course, the extra expense of staying in Manhattan will be negated by not taking subway/taxis etc   </Owner>

      <Owner>     If you could give us the address it would be helpful. I have a friend who lives in Clinton Hill and it's one of those pockets of Brooklyn that does not have easy public transportation alternatives - for instance she has to take a bus to the subway.    The only train I know that runs through Clinton Hill is the  quot;G quot; and that only along Lafayette Ave - so check where you will be in relationship to that.     And finally, Clinton Hill is between Ft Greene and Bedford-Stuyvesant, and there are intermittent sketchy blocks in the area and wonderful block in the area.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     According to Google maps we are right near the C train and the G train (both walking distance) We're about 2 blocks from Franklin Ave station location wise.     Hope that helps with whether the area is okay    I've tried a few landmarks around NYC in google maps and they all say its about a half an hour by subway.  None of us are too concerned by that really, we're in Australia - you can't get anywhere in less than half an hour here :)   </Owner>

      <Owner>     You shouldn't be taking cabs in NYC during the day as it takes just a little bit longer on the subway, and sometimes shorter!    I am sure you will be taking cabs at night after partying to get back to the apartment at 2am, but that's par for the course.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     My problem with the HomeAway site was that the owner of the flat I had booked decided to give it to someone else two weeks before my group was due to arrive. The HomeAway staff was sympathetic but did nothing.    Although I was sent my deposit back, I had to frantically look for an alternative in mid August when all the best flats and hotel rooms have gone.    I would not recommend using HomeAway because their contracts only protect the owners of the properties: if the renter cancels his booking, he loses his deposit, if the owner cancels that's just tough luck for the renter!   </Owner>

The original poster said that she found the deal on HomeAway and it appeared legitimate.  Another person said to make sure that transportation is easy, and the original poster said that she checked on Google maps and it seems to be pretty convenient. Someone pointed out that she has booked with HomeAway and the owner bailed last minute, so she had to find a new room last minute.</Summary_2>

    <Body>     We are in Niagara CA side and will be in Buffalo tomorrow. My husband will be taking the 2 hour tour of the FLW Darwin house and I will unfortunately have to miss out because there is no way our 2 boys will be able to handle it that long! So, I was wondering what I can do for 2 or so hours with the kids? I know the zoo is close but we go to the zoo by our house ALL the time and I want to do somehting else like maybe a childrens museum. Any suggestions???    Thanks so much!    Anne   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Buffalo doesn't have a children's musuem, unfortunately. The closest one is in Rochester, NY and that's a one hour drive.     The Bflo zoo is an ideal location since you can park near the Darwin Martin house and walk to the zoo. They have river otters - so cute! And you can see the elephants up close and personal if they're not outside (it looks like it might be cold tomorrow, but they do let them out when it's around freezing outside. They have a heated ramp so no worries about them slipping on the snow and ice...)    There is also a Museum of Science, but if you're used to the museums in Chicago, then this one won't compare.   tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60974-d26&#8230;    The Albright-Knox Art Gallery is not far from the D. Martin House. Not sure if your boys would find it amusing, but it has a great collection of modern art. If you wait until 3:00, museum entrance is free, and there are activities (starting around 5:00) for children and adults alike. Very fun time! If you pick up a  quot;Buffalo News quot; and look at the  quot;Gusto quot; insert, you'll find an advt, usually in the early pages, regarding the night's activities.  tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60974-d26&#8230;    To the south of town, in Lackawanna, NY, is the Botanical Gardens. A small, beautiful collection of greenhouses. Not a bad idea for little guys, especially if it's cold outside. Down the street you'll notice the Basilica, an ornate scaled down version of St. Peter's in Rome. Lots of marble and stained glass to see if you care to step in.   tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60974-d26&#8230;    Hope you find something you like to do!   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thank you Lady Dee. I read about the one in Rochester and it looks like a lot of fun! The science museum did not get great reviews and we were just at Toronto's. So, we will probably go to the zoo if the weather holds out. Otherwise find a Mcdonalds with a playland inside and let them run around!    Thanks again,    Anne   </Owner>

      <Owner>     I'm late, too, but another option, if you're interested, is the Aquatic and Fitness Center on Delaware Road in the Town of Tonawanda. They have an Olympic-size swimming pool, plus a kiddie pool with a big mushroom in the middle that showers down every few minutes. You can use the Center by purchasing a one-day pass at the rate for out-of-towners. It's about a 15-minute ride from the Darwin Martin house.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Explore and More is a children's museum in East Aurora, about 25 min south of Buffalo. How young ar eyour kids? It's great for the 6 and under. ToyTown museum is a toy museum in East Aurora and next to a Toy store on the Fisher-Price campus. If you like archetecture, visit the Roycroft campus (also in EA). Vidlers is a great store (old 5  amp; 10), kids will love it. take in a movie on Main st, Horton Hears a WHo is now playing.    </Owner>

    <Title>Plan to visit for a Buffalo Bills game</Title>
    <Owner>brownstravelg...</Owner>
    <Body>     I'm driving from Cleveland. I want to stay downtown and see a few sights on Saturday, drive to the game on Sunday (unless there's a shuttle?), then head to the casino or Niagara Falls. How far is Seneca from downtown Buffalo? Are there any other casinos? How far is Niagara Falls? Can I see enough from the US side, or should I suck it up and get a passport and go into Canada?     Any recommendations would be appreciated.    </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     You can pick up a special Game Day bus to Ralph Wilson Stadium:   http://www.nfta.com/metro/gameday-bills.asp    Niagara Falls is about 20 minutes from downtown Buffalo. You can enjoy the falls from the U.S. side, but if you want to go see the Canadian falls, you won't need a passport -- all you'll need is a birth certificate and a government-issued photo ID.    I'll let someone else answer your casino questions.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     You can expect the same weather in Buffalo as you get in Cleveland. We get your weather probably the day after you get it (from the west). It could rain, it could snow, it could be a nice, sunny day... who knows!    Regarding hotels downtown, here's a list from a previous post:  1) Hampton Inn  tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60974-d224389-&#8230;    2) Adam's Mark  tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60974-d93115-R&#8230;    3) Hyatt Regency Hotel  tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60974-d93122-R&#8230;    4) Comfort Suites  tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60974-d93128-R&#8230;    You can catch the train on Main Street and it's free as long as you stay above ground. The bus station where you will most likely catch the shuttle to the game is near Main and N. Division St, across from Church St.     Niagara Falls: The Seneca Niagara Casino is within walking distance of the actual Falls. If it's a nice day and you feel like walking, it's an easy walk to the Canadian side across the Rainbow Bridge. Just bring you birth cert and driver's license so they let you back into the USA.    There is a casino in downtown Bflo, but it's nothing special, from what I've been told.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     the metro train does not go out to ralph wilson stadium. the stadium is in orchard park, about 25 min south of buffalo. (you'll pass it on the 90 as you drive up)if you drive to the game, leave your hotel early as traffic can get thick. consider driving, tailgating is art in buffalo! it's a lot of fun to experience. i would recommend the hampton inn. good central location for night life.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Don't waste your time or money at the Canadian casinos. The slots are VERY tight and you will never see a minimum below 15/20$. Also, if you're a smoker, they are non-smoking and do NOT offer free drinks, whereas the Seneca casino on the US side does.      Go Bills! Boo Browns!   </Owner>

      <Owner>     No offense to Gear but the Canadian Casinos are far superior to the Seneca if your motivation is a nice atmoshphere, shopping, and beauty. I can not speak for the gambling outcomes. To the Seneca's credit , they have great restaurants and a very nice concert venue. If you are into casinos, I would check out both....   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thanks for all of your advice.     We went ahead and booked the Country Inn near the Falls in Canada for 3 nights (I figure we can check out the Falls since the only time I was there was when I was a toddler).      We'll drive back on Monday and check in to the hotel in Hamburg (Holiday Inn....cheap) and then go over to the stadium early for some tailgating. It looks like it's only about 5 miles away, so even with crazy traffic I'm hoping its not too big of a headache.     Is alcohol permitted in the parking lot? Little gas grills? And what about the restroom situation----are there port-o-johns available?? And how soon do they open the stadium?      Thanks so much for all of your help!      </Owner>

    <Title>Car rental in Buffalo</Title>
    <Owner>kate0680</Owner>
    <Body>     Hi Everybody,  My partner and I are thinking of hiring a car for 5.5 days from Buffalo and returning it to NYC. We are wanting to spend a couple of days in Toronto, but we are wondering if we'll have any dramas crossing the borders (we will be traveling on Australian passports/licenses). We plan to pick up the car in Buffalo on the 28th of Dec and returning it in NYC on the 2nd of Jan. What are the road conditions generally like this time year? Do you need to carry chains? or is this something the car hire company would provide? Also I've noticed when enquiring about rental cars online there are additional options inc. loss damage waiver, supplemental liability etc. I'm confused as to what kind of insurance is included and what is optional... any help would be much appreciated. Thanks :)    </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     You should check with the car rental company about their policy regarding the border-crossing into Canada. Other people have asked about that question in this forum, and I can't recall the answer, but if you do a search, you should be able to find those posts.     Our weather is quite variable at that time of year. The roads may be perfectly dry, or we may have a lot of snow. In any case, no one uses chains, and in fact I think they are illegal these days because of the damage they do to the roads. Your rental car will be equipped with all-weather tires, and that's all you'll need.    Even if it's quite snowy, the road crews are experienced in keeping the highways plowed and salted. Just maintain a safe speed. If the weather is very bad, you might need to postpone your trip if you are not experienced with driving on snow or ice. Also, be sure to take a travel kit with energy bars, some bottled water, a blanket, and a fully charged cell phone against the (unlikely) possibility that you'll get stranded.    Generally, American drivers who have insurance on their own vehicles are covered for any damage to the rental vehicle and do not need to buy the supplemental insurance offered by the rental companies -- but I'm not sure whether that's the case for someone coming from another country. You should check with your insurance company in the U.K. about their policy. At any rate, the charge for the supplemental insurance isn't too great.    Finally, because you are traveling over the holidays, do be especially careful on the roads and try to avoid traveling late at night if at all possible. You're going to be doing a lot of driving! The trip from Buffalo to New York City is about seven hours, so, especially if the weather is bad, allow yourself plenty of time for slowdowns due to holiday traffic, weather delays, etc., especially if you have a flight to catch in NYC.    Good luck, and enjoy your visit!   </Owner>

    <Title>Anchor Bar</Title>
    <Owner>MassMom</Owner>
    <Body>     We (couple w/2 boys 9  amp; 11) will be in the Niagara Falls area next month and were hoping to pass through Buffalo and check out the buffalo wings at the Anchor Bar. We once met a family while standing in line at Woodmans in Massachusetts (the inventor of the fried clam) that had made a point of visiting the restaurants that originated various food items, including the Anchor Bar, believed to be the creator of the Buffalo Wing (correct?) That sounded like a fun idea so when we travel we try to visit such historic culinary spots. Is the Anchor Bar appropriate to bring two well behaved but underage boys? I realize the Anchor Bar may not have the best wings, but are they edible? Any other food specialties we must try when passing through the area? Thanks.   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Yes, you can take your boys to the Anchor Bar -- there's a restaurant area that's separate from the bar area. The wings are not the best, in my opinion, but not bad, and certainly a trip to the Anchor Bar is worth it for the historic significance. We took some French friends there for the very same reason.    Beef on kummelweck (or  quot;weck quot;) is also a Buffalo favorite, and I think they serve it at the Anchor Bar. It's thin-sliced roast beef, with or without horseradish, on a roll that has coarse salt grains and caraway seeds on top.    Depending on which direction you're traveling and how much time you have, you might consider driving a few miles north to the Town of Tonawanda, to stop in at   Premier Gourmet, on Delaware Avenue in the Town of Tonawanda. This place is so great that tour buses come down from Canada for shopping excursions! One side of the store is Premier Wines, with wines and spirits from all over the world. Premier Gourmet has a fabulous bakery, a deli counter with cheeses from around the world as well as seafood and cold cuts, and aisles full of imported jams, jellies, candies, coffee, cookies, crackers, beer -- you name it! You can also buy gift packs of Buffalo treats, including wing sauce, sponge candy, spaghetti sauce, and one of my favorites, Quaker Bonnet brand Buffalo Chips cookies, which are coconut cookies dipped in dark chocolate.    Another local favorite is a Kool-Aid-like drink called loganberry, a non-carbonated, purplish substance that kids seem to like. You can find it at Anderson's Ice Cream (soft serve), if you want to try it.    Finally, make sure you get some fresh bread while you're here. Whenever we go away, I always miss the fresh, crusty bread they make in Buffalo. My recommendation would be a Wegmans grocery store -- and Wegmans is itself a culinary institution worth experiencing. As a friend of ours from England remarked,  quot;I've never seen so many kinds of bread in my life! quot;     Wegmans (a Western New York chain) is unlike any supermarket you will ever visit. Our favorite, on Alberta Drive in Amherst, has a sushi bar where sushi chefs prepare the day's selections right before your eyes; a French patisserie with fine pastries; a self-serve food bar for carry-out or dine in (at the cafe upstairs), with everything from samosas to my son's favorite, fried eggplant; a Charlie the Butcher stand (another Buffalo institution) where you can get beef on weck or other hot meals for carry-out or dine in; cheeses from around the world; and a section of international packaged foods that will make your jaw drop. Their produce is excellent and includes many items you can't find elsewhere, imported for the many Buffalo residents who come from other countries.    Just a couple of ideas. Have fun, and bon app&#233;tit!   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Thanks for the reply! We will try the Anchor Bar, and will definitely seek out a Wegmans. I have heard about that chain of stores but have never come across one in my travels. I think we will stop in Buffalo before heading to Niagara Falls in Canada, so now I have to figure out what food products I can buy at Wegmans and legally bring with us on our visit into Canada.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     You can bring most items over, fruits and vegetables are sometimes and issue but that is moreso returning from Canada with produce. Canadian customs is more concerned with alcohol and tobacco products....a few days worth of snacks is not a problem. Save your reciept and stay under $200 and you will be fine.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     No, you will have to declare them and usually the rule of thumb is one bottle of wine per adult per day of travel...A couple of bottles or 12 pack of beer is fine....   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>A family was planning to visit Niagara Falls and was hoping to pass through Buffalo and check out the Buffalo wings at the Anchor Bar which had a history of originating Buffalo wings. They wanted to know whether Anchor Bar was a good place for underage boys. They also wanted to know about fruits and vegetable which were legal to carry from Canada. Someone suggested that the Anchor Bar has separate restaurant area from the bar area. The wings were not the best option. There were other good restaurants in that direction which had good food, ice cream and wines. They were suggested not to carry alcohol, tobacco, potted plants and cut flowers.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person wanted to know if it's appropriate to bring two well-behaved but underaged boys to Anchor Bar and if the wings are edible. She also wanted to know if there are any other food specialties she should try when passing through Buffalo. A person responded that the original poster can bring her boys to the Anchor Bar and that the wings are not bad. She said that it's worth it for the historical significance. Another dish she likes at Anchor Bar is beef on kummelweck. As for other places to eat, she recommended: Premier Gourmet, Anderson's Ice Cream, Charlie the Butcher stand, etc.</Summary_2>

      <Owner>     Well, you're really in luck, because there's a lot going on, including the Elmwood Avenue Festival of the Arts (http://www.elmwoodartfest.org), with special activities for youngsters, performances (including one by Nikki Hicks, one of my favorite local vocalists), and food of all kinds. Elmwood Avenue is one of the area's most colorful and thriving neighborhoods, and very walkable.    The Buffalo Irish Festival is also going on that weekend -- in Hamburg, as it happens, at the fairgrounds: www.buffaloirish.com/irishfestival.htm.    You could also visit the Buffalo Zoo, take a cruise on the Miss Buffalo, attend a baseball game at Dunn Tire Park downtown (free fireworks after the games on Fridays), and attend the free evening activities at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery (also on Elmwood Ave.) on Friday night. (On the 22nd, the Gallery fun includes hands-on art projects and live music ranging from klezmer to gypsy.)    I'll add more ideas as I think of them, and I'm sure other people will add their favorite activities. Have fun!   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Depending on your time frame, a quick trip to Niagara Falls would be great. It is a 45 minute drive from Hamburg and well worth the investment of time. Otherwise you have some beaches in Angola to enjoy. If the girls like to shop you have the Galleria, which is a great expansive Mall. If you enjoy a more eclectic afternoon, lunch on Elmwood Avenue, a stroll through the Albright Know Art gallery, and hitting some of the hip shops would be a cool afternoon. Darien Lake Theme Park is 40 minutes from Hamburg if an amusement park is your thing, Marine Land in the Falls is pretty interesting as well.    </Owner>

    <Title>Parking at Buffalo Airport</Title>
    <Owner>KLM1</Owner>
    <Body>     We recently flew out of Buffalo Airport, and parked in the  quot;Preferred Long-Term Lot quot;. We thought we would pay extra to avoid the shuttle buses, and get from/to the car in the minimum amount of time, since we would be arriving back very late.     buffaloairport.com/airport_info/parking_avai&#8230;    The website advertises that Preferred Long-Term is  quot;within walking distance of the terminal quot;. That would be true if you are a marathon walker, or are fortunate enough to have one of the VERY few spots that are close to the center of the lot.    We were not so lucky. We paid $107 (minus 10% coupon) to park there for 10 days. The lot was full, so we drove forever, and ended up in the overflow lot, which is to the far left in the diagram on the website. We waited a short time for the shuttle, which took us all the way around the lot, through the Long-Term A lot and finally to the terminal.    On the way back we got on the same shuttle as the people in the Long-Term A lot, crowded like cattle, and took a trip through part of the A lot, before finally reaching the car. Fun, wow. And we paid extra for that?    To make things even more interesting, as we were leaving the lot, there was a crowd of cars trying to go out at the same time. They didn't seem to understand the concept of straight lines to follow to get to the cashier. Many people were driving sideways across the marked lines, into the side of other cars, until they were let in. I don't get it.    Bottom line ... for less hassle, and likely less $$$, we will stay in a nearby hotel and park there. There is nothing preferred about the Preferred Long-Term Lot. By paying more, I expected more.   </Body>

      <Owner>     Good to know; sorry to hear about the poor customer service. I think the only Bflo Airport lot that really is within walking distance is the shot term lot, which obviously wouldn't work for a 10 day trip. When the airport was re-built, they didn't plan for the large crowds that have appeared, many like you, from Canada. They didn't consider that market would be so great!     How rude that people were cutting in line to exit - who would let such people in front of them? I sure wouldn't... get to the back of the line where you belong - you're just not that special!     I think it is just as well off to park across the street at one of the private lots. I think they also have coupons, occasionally. The last time I parked long term across the street, the lots were so full that they just let people drop their car in a line near the entrance, and they parked it for you. Their shuttle buses seem to run more frequently than the Bflo Airport shuttle buses. Here is the link for Sunpark: aboutairportparking.com/sunpark-buf-airport-&#8230;   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>Parking at Buffalo Airport Parking a car at "Preferred Long-Term" lot buffalo airport was a bad experience. The advertisement of the website indicates the that "Preferred long term" lot is within walking distance of the terminal but that is not true as they have very few spots closer to the terminal. The parking lot was full and had to park the car at the end of over flow plot. The shuttle used to pick up people from the lot was crowded like cattle. It was an expensive to park a car. People were not driving their car in straight lines in the lot. People were inline exit. The other better place to park is 'Sunpark' which is across the street. People just need to drop their cars in line near the entrance and the Sunpark will park it on behalf of the people. The shuttle bus service of Sunpark has more frequency compared to Buffalo Airport shuttle buses.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person shared her experience parking at the Preferred Long-term lot at the Buffalo Airport. She said that it cost $107 (minus 10% coupon) to park there for 10 days. Overall, she did not have a good experience and regretted parking their. Next time, she should stay in a nearby hotel and park there instead. People thanked her for sharing, and one person shared that her experience was slightly better because when the lot were full, the staff actually parked the car for her instead.</Summary_2>

    <Title>Restaurant Recommendations</Title>
    <Owner>hercapo</Owner>
    <Body>     Will be visiting Buffalo in Feb.09 to attend a Sabres game and will be staying at the Hampton Inn-Downtown (220 Delaware). Are there any restaurants within close proximity of the hotel. We are planning on eating before the game and taking a cab to HSBC arena after. We figure we'd eat close to the hotel because I'm sure the restaurants around the arena will be very busy. Any help would be appreciated.   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Hi, hercapo! There is a place called Salsarita's that is attached to the Hampton Inn. It is a chain, but they serve good, fresh Mexican type food. There is also an Asian restaurant called Papaya right next to Salsarita's, (and also a dessert bar). There are two high end $$$ steakhouses nearby: Buffalo Chop House on Franklin St, and E.B. Green's in the Hyatt Hotel - both should be within walking distance. What kind of food/price range are you looking for?    Taxis are not easy to find in Buffalo, and by the time you call one, you could easily have walked a couple of blocks to catch the train on Main St. The train is FREE above ground which is where you'll be going to the Arena. The train picks you up right in front of the free outdoor skating rink on Main St, too. Just follow everyone else piling off to the Arena.     Hope this helps you. Please ask follow-ups if it doesn't!    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Yes, Laughlin's is good and fairly close to you.     Otherwise, if you want to eat near the arena, you could try either Pearl St Grill and Brewery (www.pearlstreetgrill.com) or City grill (268 Main), both of which you could take the train to on your way to the arena. I don't think you'd have a problem getting a table. the bars are usually crowded, but not as much for the tables.    btw, i wouldn't go for salsarita's unless you are looking for fast food.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Here is a link to the Metro Rail map: www.nfta.com/metro/systemmaps.asp?sec=3     You can get on at the first stop above ground,  quot;Theater Station quot; in front of the Shea's Theater on Main St. near Tupper St. I think Larughlin's is on Tupper - so you'll just head east to Main St, and turn right to the train stop.    </Owner>

    <Title>Question on Hotel Military Discount</Title>
    <Owner>Bflo_girl40</Owner>
    <Body>     I need some advice and hope someone can help me out. Last August I made hotel reservations online at a Homewood Suites for Christmas week. I requested the military rate. Today, more than 5 months later and a week before check-in I received a letter from the hotel stating that I will have to show  quot;gov't issued work orders specifying dates and location of gov't agency where work will be performed quot;. There is no official business as this is just a vacation and most hotels offer a military rate, just like a AAA or AARP rate. At this late date all the hotel rates are jacked up or unavailable. Their website states that the military rate requires  quot;valid ID or travel orders required at check-in quot;. What should I do?    Thanks.    </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Since the letter is from the hotel directly, I get the impression that they plan to enforce the intention of the policy. My thoughts have always been that these discounts were for folks traveling on gov't business..not a just a deal for gov't employees. AAA, AARP dicounts rarely top 10% whereas gov't and military can be as deep as 30-50% off the rack rate.     You could just play dumb and take your chances....   </Owner>

      <Owner>     One of the perks of being in the military are the discounts - all you need to show is your id card. (except in this instance). I contacted Hilton Customer Assistance regarding this matter and they were very professional and helpful about my concerns. The manager of the Buffalo-Amherst property contacted me and offered me a discount off of the rack rate, but will not honor the reservation rate. Hilton corporate stated that each property can make up their own policies regarding rates. This is a very bad business practice if they change the terms of the reservation.    </Owner>

    <Title>Staying in Buffalo - see Niagara Falls</Title>
    <Owner>Howiesue</Owner>
    <Body>     Hi. My wife and I will be staying at a hotel in Buffalo NY (Rainbow Blvd) end of May, visiting from Australia. We will have a rental car thru' Europcar US. Can anyone please advise:-    1) As I am British Passport holder will there be any visa requirements crossing into Canada?    2) Is anyone aware if Europcar allow US rented cars to cross temporarily into Canada?    3) If yes, what are driver licence requirements (I have an Australian licence)?    4) Not good but we have only a day to do this - is this feasible including Maid of the Mist?    Lady Dee, any comments?    Cheers, Howiesue.   </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     I can answer a couple of your questions:     Rainbow Blvd. is in Niagara Falls, New York, not actually in Buffalo, so it will be quite easy for you to see the Falls in a day.     You can see the Falls and take a ride on the Maid of the Mist from either the U.S. or Canadian side of the border. If you board the boat on the U.S. side, it will return you to the U.S., and if you board in Canada you will return to Canada, so there are no visa/passport problems either way.    I'm not familiar with Europcar, but it appears from their website that they work with National car rental. You would have to contact National to find out whether they would allow you to cross into Canada.    Your closest Canadian consulate should be able to advise whether or not you will need a visa if you enter Canada from the U.S.    Here's a site with information about driving in Ontario if you hold a license from another country:  mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/visiting.shtml    Good luck...   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Hi Howiesue;    1) You will only need a valid passport to enter Canada.  Canadian Border Services Agency's website;  http://207.219.111.92/requirements/steps4_1_1.aspx?id=197    2) There are some car rental companies that will not permit their cars out of the state or out of the country. Most of the larger rental companies will allow cross border travel.    Ensure that the car rental company notes on the rental agreement that they authorize you to take the car into Canada. You may be asked by Customs when entering Canada, or when re-entering the US, for this documentation.    Best Regards   </Owner>

      <Owner>       I DO NOT know if this is necessary.. I live in the general area..    There are four bridges across the Niagara River.    You will want the ****Rainbow Bridge***..That is one of them which you can walk across..and is also closest to Niagara Falls..    When we first moved to the area , no one told us that there were 4 bridges into Canada.. and we got a bit comfused.    Hope this also helps you.  alice   </Owner>

      <Owner>     Hey, Howiesue! I tsounds like your hotel is in walking distance from the Niagara Falls themselves. You dont' even have to drive there, you can walk across the Rainbow Bridge to Canada. There is more to see and do there than on the States' side. Maid of the Mist is on both sides of teh border, but I hear the lines are shorter on the US side.     Sorry you'll miss Buffalo NY!     --Dee   </Owner>

    <Summary_1>Howiesue and his wife would be staying at a hotel in Buffalo NY (Rainbow Blvd) end of May, visiting from Australia. They would have a rental car thru' Europcar US. They needed advise for visa requirements for British Passport Holder during border crossing into Canada, U.S. rental car(Europcar) in Canada, Driver licence requirement and time requirement to visit all the places in Niagara Fall including maid of the mist. According to Pastiche, one day was sufficient to see the Falls. Falls can be seen in one day and ride on the maid of the Mist can be taken from both the sides of the borders. He suggested Howiesue to check the following website for visa requirement. According to RescueTeam, Howiesue would need a valid passport to enter Canada. More information was available on canadian border service agency's website.  There were some car rental companies that would not permit their cars out of the state or out of the country. Most of the larger rental companies would allow cross border travel. Howiesue needs to ensure that the car rental company notes on the rental agreement that they authorize you to take the car into Canada. Howiesue may be asked by Customs when entering Canada, or when re-entering the US, for this documentation.  Alicemagoo informed that there were four bridges across the Niagara River.Howiesue would wanted to walk on the Rainbow bridge which was closest to Niagara Fall. According to Lady_Dee, Howiesue's hotel was in walking distance from the Niagara Falls and he dont have to drive there.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>A person wanted to know if, as a British Passport holder, she'll need any visa to cross into Canada and does EuropCar allow their cars to cross into Canada. She also wanted to know about the driver license requirements (she has an Australian license) and if it is feasible to include Maid of the Mist. One person said that the original poster will only need a valid passport to enter Canada. Another person responded that it is feasible to include Maid of the Mist to her list of activities. A couple of people mentioned that the original poster could park in the US side and walk across Rainbow Bridge to go to Canada instead.</Summary_2>

      <Owner>     Hey Gaznetonthenile,    If you are looking to take the most economical way from the airport to Niagara Falls, Canada you might want to try the Buffalo and Niagara transportation network known as NFTA (Niagara Frontier Transport Authority). They offer transit services to and from Buffalo, north to Lewiston, and I believe as far as Niagara Falls, NY. You would want to take the bus from the airport to the  quot;Rainbow Bridge border crossing quot; and walk across, with passport's handy of course. Once you cross, you go through passport control and you are in the touristy area of Niagara Falls (Clifton Hill).    Hope this helps!   </Owner>

Bedore tours offers a nice package but I am not sure they can pick up and drop off at the airport. You may want to e-mail them for more info otherwise the Buffalo Visitors Center staff can be very helpful.    More info forwarded from Gray Line tours after I contacted them:     We run our canadian Rainbow tour seven days a week. Pick-up at the Buffalo Airport will be at 10:30 a.m. every day; however, for this pickup we need to have at least two people and the reservation made at least the day before.     This tour will be going over to the Canadian Side therefore they will need the correct border crossing documents, passports will be great. The cost of the tour is $79.95 per person. Some of the main attractions are the: Journey Behind the Falls, Reif Winery and the Skylon Tower. Much of the history of the falls will also be narrated by your driver who doubles as your guide.     In terms of their arrival flight, it should come in no later then 9:00 a.m.; just as well, their departing flight should be at about 7:00 p.m. just to be safe with border crossing and the variouse drop-off's along the way, and also figuring in the time it takes to get through security at the airport.

      <Owner>     The least expensive way will be to rent a car, park on the US side, and walk across. If you are going for the day this is inexpensive, probably no more then $50 for the daily rental.    </Owner>

      <Owner>     Hi gslee;    Boston is NOT near Buffalo. It is approx. 456 miles / 734 km away.     If your intention was to go from New York City to Niagara Falls, I would suggest cancelling your flight to Boston, and book a flight to Buffalo. (BUF)     Niagara Falls is approx. 21 miles / 34 km from Buffalo.    Best Regards   </Owner>

      <Owner>     sorry...I should have added a comment about using a rental car.    There are some car rental companies that will not permit their cars out of the state or out of the country, or charge a premium if they do. Most of the larger rental companies will allow cross border travel.    Ensure that the car rental company notes on the rental agreement that they authorize you to take the car into Canada. You may be asked by Customs when entering Canada, or when re-entering the US, for this documentation.    Unless you plan to drive around the region, I would NOT suggest renting a car.

    <Body>     I will be staying with family for a week in July in Sag Harbor. The house they rented has a pool but is not close to the beach. I would like to know the best beach to go to for the day, that allows day only parking. I am willing to drive up to 45 minutes and of course expect to pay for parking.    </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner>     Are you looking for the ocean or the bay?    Depending on where you are in Sag Harbor, the nearest beach is Long Beach in North Haven. You drive over the bridge in town, and make a left at the circle. There is also Havens Beach, which is ideal for children. If you want the ocean, you'll have to travel to East Hampton or Southampton. There are numerous beaches to choose from in East Hampton.   </Owner>

      <Owner>     If it is the soft sands of an ocean beach you want there are a number of options in both Southampton and East Hampton towns, each within easy distance of Sag Harbor. Bridgehampton's Scott Cameron Beach may be the closest for you, at about a fifteen minute drive. Do read signs before you park at any beach or you may get a ticket - or worse, get towed, unless it is after six pm.     Beaches with lifeguards, which I am assuming you will want, usually sell day passes. Call 631-283-6000 for Southampton's Town Hall to find out where to go in that town and East Hampton's for their list.     Coopers Beach on the ocean in Southampton Village is a very nice family beach with bathrooms and a snack bar. It was recently voted one of the top beaches in America - unfortunately for us as it is attracting many new visitors. I believe it still sells day passes, but I hear they can sell out on busy days. Call Village Hall to find out more: 631-283-0247.   </Owner>

    <Title>installing apps does not always add menu items</Title>
    <Owner>tariq</Owner>
    <Body> i'm anew user ... i unmasked the  quot;universe quot; repositories to install scribus and lyx (amongst other things).  scribus did appear in the new menu ... but lyx didn't. some other itens such as games didn't.  is there a good way to ensure that installed apps from ubuntu packages do appear for all users? myself i don't mind launching them from the command line but the intended users will not know this and are not command line users.   i did explore /etc/menu and /lib/menus (memory might not be correct here) ... but it didn't work.  i've previously given them mandrake - becuase even if the menus were cluttered and the desktop not so clean - at least everying was available to them from the menu! </Body>

There should be a header or information listed about the person who packaged the app in the description. You could send an email to that person to request they add the menu. </Owner>

      <Owner> thanks to the last poster - that was veyr useful advice (i'm not a gnome / nautilus person myself .. i use xfec and the command line!)  just to check:  * i will install packages one by one * for each installed package i will check that it appears in the menu * if it does not i shall do as the above poster suggested  however - do i need to log out and back in to be sure the installed app did not add a menu item. i say this as there may be a  quot;refresh menus quot; which some install scripts may/may not call.  am i right? is therea refresh-menus command i can do myself without having to logout and back in again between application installs.  forgibe my lack of gnome knowledge!  thanks </Owner>

      <Owner> You know, that this has been an interesting discussion, but it still misses the point that application packagers should be adding the menu support in their packages. If they did that, then there wouldn't be a need to go back and manually do all of this. Some of them do, but unfortunately, many do not (and won't until people harp on it). </Owner>

      <Owner> Debian has probably the most advanced menu support in linux distributions.  Ubuntu does not use it.  Ubuntu uses gnome menus.  If you install a kde desktop on debian, you get a kde menu system with a debian entry which is redundant because it lists all of the installed packages, not just the kde ones. The same goes for gnome. Ubuntu does not seem to use the debian menus.  All debian packages add entries to the debian menu.  I guess it makes for really neat menus, but loses some compatibility with the packages from Universe.... </Owner>

      <Owner> This is a bug in the Ubuntu version of OpenOffice. It has been filed as a bug report, confirmed and marked as critical. No one has a fix for it yet. However, if you install the official OpenOffice from openoffice.org, everything works as expected with no bug.  The install is a bit involved, due to the large number of files to download and install, but there are easy-to-follow instructions that I can post if you're interested in taking that route. </Owner>

      <Owner> Okay, folks, here is the answer I got on the OpenOffice Impress forum (don't know if you have to create a free account to read it or not). A couple of things to note first: You need Alien to convert the RPMS. It's easy to get (info in the link). There is a desktop integration mentioned for GNOME, but the files you download include desktop integration for KDE as well. You'll just have to check the names of the files in the integration folder and change the text in the command line shown in the link.  Other than that, I was impressed by the extra speed and stability of the  quot;factory quot; version of OpenOffice versus the version provided with Ubuntu.  http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?p=194370#194370 </Owner>

      <Owner> This is probably a different problem, but I'll throw it in here in case someone searches for it...  I installed Kubuntu Feisty from scratch on 3 different machines, one with the LiveCD and two with the Alternate. On all machines, when I tried to open my OO 2.0.4 spreadsheets, OO calc crashed.  I finally narrowed it down to something this simple: open a brand new spreadsheet, add a button control, add an event 'when mouse button released' to link it to a macro (Sub Main will do). Try to exit design mode - crash.  After trying a number of complicated things, I happened to uninstall all of OO and reinstall it from the repos (in Adept). Problem solved on all three machines.  So I know it sounds Windows-like, but if you're getting OO crashes I suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the whole OO set. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user had an issue with open office crashing on exit. The user observed that the app worked fine but when it got close, the app crashed, the crash recovery thing came up and then opened a blank document.  The other user also experienced the same problem. The user also experienced impress crashing i.e. the presentation only crashed after it was being tested. The problem was due to the bug in the ubuntu version of Open office. The bug report was filed, confirmed and marked as critical. No fix had been found for this problem. The solution of the problem was to install the official openoffice from openoffic.org. The install was a bit involved, due to the large number of files to download and install, but there were easy-to-follow instructions. The instructions were: Go to the OpenOffice Impress forum where the user needs to create a free account to read it. A user needs Alien to convert the RPMS. It's easy to get as the information is available in the link. There is a desktop integration mentioned for GNOME, but the files user download include desktop integration for KDE as well. The user just has to check the names of the files in the integration folder and change the text in the command line shown in the link. The other user also experienced the similar problem. The other problem was the fonts with feisty installed OO2.2 looked way better than the fonts with the downloaded OO2.2 The solution for the font&#8217;s problem was available on this link.http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewto...=194370#194370 The other user experienced one more problem. The user installed Kubuntu Feisty from scratch on 3 different machines, one with the LiveCD and two with the Alternate. On all machines, when a user tried to open my OO 2.0.4 spreadsheets, OO calc crashed. The user finally narrowed it down to something this simple: open a brand new spreadsheet, add a button control, add an event 'when mouse button released' to link it to a macro/ Try to exit design mode - crash. After trying a number of complicated things, the user uninstalled all of OO and reinstall it from the repos (in Adept). Problem solved on all three machines.  The other user reported that the reinstallation/uninstallation doe not fixed with the crash problem. The bug behind the crash problem was sudo aptitude reinstall openoffice.org-base-core openoffice.org-calc openoffice.org-common openoffice.org-core openoffice.org-draw openoffice.org-hyphenation openoffice.org-impress openoffice.org-kde openoffice.org-style-crystal openoffice.org-style-human openoffice.org-thesaurus-en-au openoffice.org-thesaurus-en-us openoffice.org-writer - does not decide a problem ((((((((((</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to crashing of Open Office Impress on exiting on only after have tested the presentation. As this is bug in Ubuntu version of OpenOffice and is confirmed and marked as critical. This can be sometimes resolved as following: One need Alien to convert the RPMS. It's easy to get (info in the link). There is a desktop integration mentioned for GNOME, but the files download include desktop integration for KDE as well. But just have to check the names of the files in the integration folder and change the text in the command line shown in the link.  http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?p=194370#194370. This exit crash problem perhaps needs to be fixed with an update by Canonical. Nevertheless, One can always install the official OpenOffice from openoffice.org, everything will work with no bug or [Ubuntu] Installing OOo on Debian and Co.</Summary_2>

    <Title>Changing mount point with ntfs-3g</Title>
    <Owner>GMaq</Owner>
    <Body> Hello, I am dual-booting XP and Feisty, and have a partition for Feisty (ext2) a partition for XP (ntfs) and a common work partition for both Os's(ntfs). Everything is working wonderfully except that I set the mount point as /media/Work Drive/ and many applications and anything in the terminal don't like the  quot;white space quot; between  quot;Work quot; and  quot;Drive quot; so I want to change the name in the mount point. I am using the NTFS Configuration Tool and it utilizesthe drives perfectly but doesn't allow me to change the mount point. I am still a beginner with terminal command lines, so any guidance would be appreciated. </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> If you mount it through /etc/fstab, you can just edit it   Code: and replace it with the new mount point. Then, save it and create the new mount point so it can mount to it, assuming the new mount point is called /media/Drive.   Code: Then, reboot. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>Changing mount point with ntfs-3g The user is trying to change the mount point in the dual-booting Feisty (ext2) and XP (ntfs) system but unable to change it. Mount code can be changed by editing or by replacing it with the new mount point which is saved by assuming the new mount point called as media/Drive and then reboot the system. The user is also trying to delete the media folder from the work drive and is unable to delete via the file manager. The user wants to know the command to remove the obsolete folder from the terminal. The folder can be removed by the code which is typed after typing the password.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to the change of the mount point because of the "white space" between "work" and "drive" in the terminal command line.

    <Title>Mounting new CD/DVD RW</Title>
    <Owner>malre1</Owner>
    <Body> I have just replaced my CD ROM with a CD/DVD RW machine and although the system does see it their it is not mounted. Could someone please give me or point me to where I can get clear instruction on how to mount. In the partitions settings it sez  Device /dev/scd0 Mount point /media/cdrom0 FS type udf,iso9660 Mount options user,noauto,exec  I would like it to be auto mounted.  Thanks and regards </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> I believe you don't mount the driver itself, rather you mount any cd/dvd you put into the drive. Once you put the disc in go to the terminal and use the command  mount -t type dev dir  where   type is the type of file system, e.g iso9660 or ntfs, it will usually say the type  dev is the dev/sdc0 part you were talking about  dir is the point you want to access the files from, e.g /mnt/mycd  Once you've done that if you go to /mnt/mycd you should see your files.  Don't know if this is want you wanted, but hope it helped anyway.  to unmount use the command  umount dev  regards </Owner>

      <Owner> /mnt/mycd was just a suggestion, if you haven't made the folder then it won't exist. I think cd's and dvd's are mounted automatically in ubuntu, I was just telling you the mount stuff for general purposes, e.g. external hard drive. Have you looked around in your /media folder when you have a cd/dvd in the drive? I think mine usually goes to /media/cdrom or /media/cdrom0. let me know how it goes. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user had a problem with mounting of a CD ROM with a CD/DVD RW machine. The user needed clear instruction on how to mount. The user wanted to have auto mounted.

    <Summary_2>The discussion is in regard to auto mounting of CD/DVD RW when put it in system Kubuntu 7.10. Perhaps, this is resolved as cd and dvd are mounted automatically in ubuntu but have to looked into appropriate drives for the location. However, user couldn't able to mount it. It is yet to be resolved.</Summary_2>

If that is the case, couldn't someone just as easily create a piece of malware that consistently asks for a users password this way? And if the user is dumb enough to enter his password, (granted that he is a sudo user) potentially infect his whole system?  Just wondering out of curiosity... And concern.  Regards Iain </Body>

      <Owner> Hello, cmay.  Which version of Ubuntu are you using?  I also have very low vision, and I use the eZoom plugin which is in Compiz Fusion, and I turn on a feature for mouse-pointer scaling which makes the mouse pointer increase in size if you zoom the desktop. It si extremely helpful.  if you have Ubuntu 7.10 installed on your system, you can install CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) to make setup a bit easier for you.  Please let me know what version of Ubuntu you are using, and maybe I can help you to get all set up.  If you have ever used programs such as ZoomText or Magic on Windows, (in my opinion) Compiz Fusion's eZoom plugin blows those programs way out of the water. It makes my life a WHOLE LOT esier. This was the thing I was waiting for to completely switch to Ubuntu, and when it arrived in v7.10, I jumped off of the Windows canoe and finally got myself a yacht.   Anyhow, take care, and please write back and et me know if I can be fo any help to you. </Owner>

      <Owner> Hi, Cmay, I not got an answer to you qsn regards a program for ppl with bad vision - in that regards, I personally use a mac, and it's easy to enlarge anything there, but I can, however, give you and any1 else reading this a few tips on how to make sure our eyesight doesnt worsen. You can also restore your eyesight. When you work with a pc, read a book, or when you are doing anything else that requires you to stare at it for a long time, especially close up, you need look around the room, look into the distance now and again. If you do that, your eyesight will NOT get worse. Otherwise, it WILL - it's only normal, only common sense. If you do start noticing your eyesight worsening, then you can start doing more exercises - move your eyes up, down, left, right, look onto your nose etc - do this for a couple of mins once every hour or so, then close your eyes and relax. If you put your hands over your face, so that your eyes are right in the middle of your palms, with no light getting through, and stay like this for a minimum of 3 mins, then your eyes will relax and you'll see a huge improvement. It'll help a lot. If you do this, the n you'll never need to were glasses, no matter what age you are, or what work you do. Hope some1 will read this  amp; it helps - I know, I've been there.

I'm using Ubuntu 8.04 LTS I have to say though, I've found Compiz, less then stable, in previous releases, it still messes up / corrupts the screen too often. Thank you </Owner>

      <Owner>  Quote: Hi,  I just moved to Ubuntu and don't rely on zoom things as much but there was a time when I could not live without ZoomText being on. So for future ref, how do you install compiz fusion and eZoom? I've heard so much about the former but cannot find a d/l link and if you say ezoom is better than ZT I am anxious to see its potential. don't think I'll use it since linux finally lets me tweak the computer and things so i can see it but for reference y'know.  </Owner>

      <Owner> If you set the font size in Firefox, make sure to use the Advanced options and set the minimum font size, and disable the option to let pages choose their own fonts. I have my default font size in firefox at 16pt and the minimum at 13. Many pages will look crappy because they aren't written to expand to acommodate user-chosen font sizes. If you use a site like that a lot you should contact them and let them know they are ignoring important accessibility guidelines that may even be legal obligations in their country, as well as alienating possible customers.  Don't forget you can zoom text in Firefox using the Ctrl-+ and Ctrl-- hotkeys or Ctrl-mousewheel, Ctrl-0 to reset. Firefox 3 remembers the zoom level on a per-site basis so you don't need the nosquint addon anymore. To stop images zooming with the text you need to enter about:config in the address bar, type  quot;browser-zoom-full quot; in the filter field and double-click it set it to false. You can also change the  quot;zoom.maxpercent quot; and  quot;zoom.minpercent quot; settings here.  For magnification I use Compiz with the Enhanced Zoom Desktop and Place Windows plugins. I don't use the Magnifier plug in. To get a window double-size and filling the screen I use this combo, although I may have changed the key bindings from the defaults (Super means the  quot;Windows quot; key quot;):  Super-Keypad-5 - centres the current window (Place Windows plugin) Super-2 - doubles the screen magnification (Zoom plugin) Super-v - resizes the window to the current screen size, i.e. x2 (Zoom plugin). It won't be centred any more though, so... Super-Keypad-5 to centre it again or...  Super-Keypad-N - move the window to N position on the screen, e.g. 7 is top-left, 3 is bottom-right and... Super-r - move and rezoom to fit the current window.  In general, Super-v resizes the window to the zoom level, and Super-r will move and resize the zoomed desktop to the current window. Alt-tabbing between windows will also move the zoomed desktop between them but not resize to fit them. Don't forget Super with the mouse wheel will zoom the desktop to arbitrary values.  You can also constrain the mouse to the zoomed area and scale the mouse with the window, so It's like every application has its own double size desktop. Personally I hate it when the screen moves around as I move the mouse, although you can leave the mouse unconstrained and use the mouse panning option so the screen only moves when you hit the edge, lessening the feeling of  quot;motion sickness quot;  This approach saves you messing around with font sizes in lots of different places - I would say it's impossible to get all applications set up the way you want them, too many ignore the system font settings.  Using this method I can have all windows at double size and switch between them using alt-tab or any of the application switching plugins for Compiz. To reset to 100% zoom simply hit Super-1. You can in fact customise the hotkey zoom levels too, so I have them at 100%, 75%, and 50%. 75% is good for firefox otherwise the toolbars take up too much room and many pages just won't fit in the space. The downside is I can only see the panels when I zoom out to 100%, so I miss flashing icons in the notification area.  So you don't have to use the above combo on every window you open, the Window Rules plugin lets you set the size and position of any windows you open, so you could set it up so all windows are automatically 1/2 the width and height of your display, and position them in the centre, although you'd have to do some math since it takes the top left corner as the position. This has much the same effect as setting your screen resolution to half, except your panels won't be visible so you'd have a little more screen space. There is a problem in that you can't stop the Place Windows plugin from doing smart placement (where it places new windows as far as possible from existing ones - I shall report this as a bug), and this may mess with setting up fixed window placements in the Window Rules plugin.  On the important subject of eyestrain and other computer related disorders, there is a program in the Ubuntu repos called Workrave, I highly recommend it. It is a timer that nags you to take microbreaks, rest breaks, and limit your daily computer usage. It is much smarter than other similar programs that will nag you even if you have just returned from a break. If you are bad for skipping breaks you can even set it to lock the screen, although it will let you skip or postpone a break if you absolutely must.  I take a 20 second microbreak every 5 minutes where I stand up and look out the window at the farthest thing I can see. Every 45 minutes I take a 5 minute break where I walk around and relax my upper body, or do some household chores (I work from home). My eyes no longer water, my eyelids no longer twitch, my wrist and lower back pain are gone, and I seem to get my work done faster as a result. I know computers can enhance the lives of people who are differently abled in various ways, but you must take steps to ensure they don't negatively affect your health in the long term.  Hope this helps you some, I shall watch this thread so if you need any further clarification feel free to ask, it is a lot to take in all at once. Compiz has many accessibility features but that can make it difficult to find the ones you need and configure them however suits you best.   Code:  Quote:  </Owner>

      <Owner> I am using compiz with the ezoom plugin in 8.04 it comes pre installed not necessarily pre-configured   What i find useful:  Super/Windows Key + Scroll up on mouse :   This does not limit you to 3 zoon levels and allows you to modify the zoom level at will.  If you have a five button mouse you can set the Super / Windows key + back button to reset view.  Super/Windows Key + m: Inverts everything bar the desktop  Super/Windows Key + n: Inverts the current window useful for firefox when you have a page with black background.  Just as a side note getting this all to work is a little easier said than done. I have an ATI HD card connected through HDMI to a 32 inch TV screen. This was not straight forward.   Some hardware can be very troublesome and others not compiz sometime just works out of the box straight after install the best way to check is Super/Windows Key + m if everything goes inverted your in business. Otherwise you may need to start by installing proprietary driver support and or the GLX package for your graphics card.  ** GLX WARNING : This may break your graphics output on reeboot. Be sure you are aware and can see enough to do a xorg reset in recovery mode.  If the GLX goes in okay if you may need to enable it by going System - gt; Preferences - gt; Appearance. Then navigate to the last tab Visual Effects and change the button to normal. If it works then it will ask you to keep the settings otherwise it will complain that it can not start. Back to the drawing board at that point.   It can be worth checking the forums for your graphics card and if it supports compiz and how hard/easy it is to setup.  This is not a full gude but give you ideas of where you need to start looking. In my experience compiz will not work on anything less than 1Ghz machine and thats a push. Not many of those around, just in my room.   Tom </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user wanted to know about the programs which help people who could barely see. The user installed the supertux and restarted the computer. The user observed the change in the font sizes. The font size was previously at 23 but after the restart it was observed incredibly small. The user has registered himself/herself on the forum to get help but because of the wrong password, the user was unable to login on the forum website.  The other option was to keep Compiz fusion enabled so the user can use the zoom magnifier plugins. One of the users moved the thread to Assistive Technology and Accessibility Discussions to get better help. There was an extension for fixefox known as no squint which can be helpful. More information can be found at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2592. One of the users, who had very low vision, used the eZoom plugin which was in the Compiz Fusion. The user turned on a feature for mouse-pointer scaling which made the mouse pointer increase in size when zoom the desktop. The Compix Config Settings Manager CCSM can be installed on Ubuntu 7.10. The user felt Compiz Fusion's ezoom plugin was better than ZoomText or Magic. In firefox the user can increase the font size from view&gt;Text Size then click increase. A quicker way to increase is to press ctrl and move scroll up or down to down to zoom in or out. Low resolution will give the large screen size which would have huge letters, images, etc The user was suggested as follows if he/she set the font size in Firefox, make sure to use the Advanced options and set the minimum font size, and disable the option to let pages choose their own fonts. I have my default font size in firefox at 16pt and the minimum at 13. Many pages will look crappy because they aren't written to expand to acommodate user-chosen font sizes.

The good source that can help is searching the thread  "Assistive Technology and Accessibility Discussions".The user is advised from another similar characteristic person  who has very low vision,who uses the eZoom plugin which is in Compiz Fusion, and to turn on a feature for mouse-pointer scaling which makes the mouse pointer increase in size by zoom the desktop. This feature is best when Ubuntu 7.10 installed on your system, also can install CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) to make setup easier.

      <Owner> I also have an HP DeskJet 5850 network printer -- it worked fine in Debian Sarge, but I have not been able to get it working properly in Ubuntu Breezy. The configuration details are simple: HP JetDirect (actually IPP), static IP number of the printer, and port 9100; using the HP-DeskJet_5850-hpijs.ppd driver.   In my case, the Ubuntu test page was shifted 2.5cm (1in) upwards, clipping the top of the page. And printing a PDF-file straight to the printer with  quot;lp file.pdf quot; puts the printer all of a sudden in double-sided mode -- even though I have it configured as single-sided.  I believe the problem is in the  quot;gnome-cups-manager quot; package that is used via the Administration/Printing menu. May be it detects that the double-sided attachment is installed on the printer, and assumes that it then also should be used... In Debian Sarge I did the identical configuration via the http://localhost:631 interface, but this route is disabled in Ubuntu. I have filed a bug about this -- #17820, so I am waiting for a solution on this. </Owner>

    <Title>XMMS alternatives</Title>
    <Owner>nocturn</Owner>
    <Body> After going to some issues, I got XMMS working on Ubuntu. Now, I've been using XMMS for years now, and I've always loved it, but lately I've been under the impression that development kinda stopped (or is very, very slow).  So I'm looking at alternatives for it, but none that really suit my need. Ideally, I would like XMMS with GTK2 support and the ability to load newer winamp skins.  I looked at Beep (XMMS fork to GTK2), but it does did not work very well for me. I wanted to try Rhythmbox, but it wanted to search through my music directories (which takes forever so I killed it).  Are there any others that I'm not aware of? I'm not looking for something with indexing capabilities like Rhythmbox. </Body>

      <Owner> You might want to try Muine which is now in Gnome CVS. It's a little dependancy-heavy, but a great app. I haven't used it in a while but, I'm compiling it now and maybe I'll post a .deb if I get around to it.  Edit: Maybe not, the deps are ugly and SourceForge is down for maintenance (as usual) so I can't even grab the gtk# libs. Looks like I'll wait for it in hoary or the backports (wink, wink jdong). </Owner>

      <Owner> Muine rocks, it's probably my favorite.  Rhythmbox might be hanging because you have other files in your music folders. Images, text files, etc, will cause it to hang.  Zinf is pretty nifty as well, but I like Muine and Rythmbox the best because of their lightweightedness (no that's not a word) </Owner>

You can get more skins for it by installing xmms-skins from universe, opening /usr/share/xmms/Skins in your file browser, and dragging the *.tgz files into the Preferences - gt; Appearance - gt; Skin pane.

    <Summary_1>The user had experienced a problem with XMMS on Ubuntu. The XMMS got slowed. The user wanted XMMS with GTK1 support and the ability to load newer winamp skins. The user looked at Beep (XMMS fork to GTK2), but it does did not work very well for him/her. The user wanted to try Rhythmbox, but it wanted to search through the music directory which was taking more time. The other user was also unable to run XMMS on Ubuntu. The user tried installing dependencies and XMMS but observed the error message as no acceptable C compiler found at $Path. The user tried installing it from Universe and it worked well. It was suggested to get an extra lib if the user had a nvidia card. Music Player Daemon (with client) can be a good replacement for XMMS. It can be downloaded from http://www.musicpd.org/ A possible alternative for XMMS (with the same kind of GUI) is Beep Media Player http://www.sosdg.org/~larne/w/BMP_Homepage Deb package on this page. http://www.imendio.com/projects/jamboree/  The user found a 'lightweight' indexing mp3 itunes-like prog for Gnome. The user tried loading songs which took 3 hours. The music files were on an NFS server. The other user loaded xmms Hashimoto as the rhythmbox did not load all the songs. http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/xmms2/ I couldn't get it to install tho. can be the other alternative to XMMS. According to the Rhythmbox faq, problem was due a GStreamer bug that doesn't recognize some mp3 types. One of the users wanted to know the name of the extra lib for nvidia card users. The user was suggested to search the name in the thread. Amarok was another alternative to XMMS. It was similar to iTunes. The user was suggested Muine, which was in Gnome CVS. It was a little dependancy-heavy but was a great app. Zinf was pretty nifty as well. One of the users had downloaded the Muine and  needed information about the installation. Following was the information to Muine installation; click the install file from the download files. Follow the instructions mentioned in it. Make sure the system has got all the requirements stated in the README file. One of the users also faced XMMS problem so he/she was suggested to get libmikmod if a user had a nvidia card. AmaroK is used to run KDE programs on a gnome system but its appearance would be ugly unless the user installs the rest of KDE. The other alternative for XMMS was the Beep Media Player. The user can get more skins for it by installing  XMMS-skins from universe by opening /usr/share/xmms/Skins in your file browser, and dragging the *.tgz files into the Preferences -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Skin pane. The other way to run the XMMS is to follow instructions mentioned on the webpage http://blog.sartek.net/2008/04/insta...rdy-heron.html</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This question was in regard to XMMS alternatives working in Ubuntu as it became very slow over years (almost stopped). But the user need XMMS with GTK2 support and the ability to load newer winamp skins. The user tried Beep (XMMS fork to GTK2) and Rhythmbox but did not liked it. The user is not particularly looking for something with indexing capabilities like Rhythmbox.To run XMMS on Ubuntu if error message encounters saying  'no acceptable C compiler found at $Path' just installed it from Universe (or multivers install it from Universe (or multivers), for nvidia card need an extra library  libmikmod If fonts are tiny and  together have to install non-truetype fonts that match the resolution. Rhythmbox might be hanging because you have other files in the user music folders. Images, text files, etc, will cause it to hang. Zinf is pretty nifty, where as Muine and Rythmbox something to do with lightweightedness. Using Zinf, its display is not nice. To install Muine properly, one has to Look at the 'INSTALL' file in download. Opening it with an editor, and will find installation instructions. one has to make  sure all the requirements stated in the 'README' file without them run into problem. To take advantage of mysql needs 2 apps: mp3kult and prokyon3. For a good source to compile and run XMMS can refer to http://blog.sartek.net/2008/04/insta...rdy-heron.html</Summary_2>

    <Title>Default program per file extension ?</Title>
    <Owner>abelthorne</Owner>
    <Body> Hello, Is it possible in Ubuntu to set a default program for a file extension, indepentdently of its content? AFAIK, Linux doesn't use extensions to recognize the type of a file (I guess it uses MIME).  My problem is that Scribus files (.sla) are plain text files (XML I think). So, when I double-click on one, it will open with the text editor. I can right-click on one and select  quot;open with Scribus quot; in the menu, but that's not very user-friendly. If I set the default program for this kind of file to Scribus, I get an error message saying  quot;the filename says that its a Scribus file but the content says plain text quot; and doesn't let me open the file. And BTW, if I add Scribus to the default programs list it will appear twice in the contextual menu and it will appear in the menu of plain text files, which I don't want to.  How do I - if possible - sort this out? </Body>

Perhaps, other way to do it is Open mime.types: sudo gedit /etc/mime.types &gt; Search for file extension: &lt;ctrl+f&gt; &#8220;file type&#8221; &gt; Copy Mimetype &gt; Create a backup of defaults.list: sudo cp /usr/share/applications/defaults.list /usr/share/applications/defaults.list.backup &gt; Open defaults.list: sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/defaults.list &gt; Search for Mimetype: &lt;ctrl+f&gt; &lt;ctrl+v&gt; (mimetype should still be on the clipboard) &gt; List available applications: ls /usr/share/applications/*.desktop &gt; Change default application or Mimetype in the form [mime-type]=[new-app].desktop &gt; Save mime.types &gt; Restart nautilus: killall nautilus</Summary_2>

    <Body> hi.. m not entirely sure where to post this, but since m customising my desktop ll put it here..  i want to change the color of the background of thunar file manager.. or even possibly use an image as a background... does anyone know if this is possible?   i *think* something can be done by editing a gtk config file.., but i wouldnt even know where to start..   can anyone pls advise?  i had a look around google  amp; xfce  amp; thunar websites/wiki.. but the documentation isnt great.. so any relevant linkage is also warmly received.. : s)  thanks. </Body>

    <Title>Saving the changes to Desktop in Gutsy</Title>
    <Owner>Dark Hornet</Owner>
    <Body> Ok...so I did a clean install of Gutsy yesterday, and everything went smooth....I installed my restricted drivers, set my screen resolution, etc, etc. Then I came to modifying my desktop settings, most notably the tool bars at the bottom and top of my desktop. I removed the items that I didn't want, and added some others, so that everything was just how I like it. The issue comes when I either restart X, or reboot the machine--when my desktop comes up after a reboot, the  quot;bottom quot; toolbar is always at the top of the screen right under the top one.....How can I save the settings so that this does not happen.  **EDIT**--I have already tried to go  quot;Sessions quot; and check the save session on reboot option.  Thanks for any help you can provide. </Body>

    <Title>Desktop icon are arranged alphabetical for new users</Title>
    <Owner>jakommo</Owner>
    <Body> Hi all,  we run a internetcafe based on a diskless linux system. till now we used gentoo + kde but I'm working on an new system based on ubuntu + gnome.  it just works fine expect one big problem: for each customer a account is created with a customized Desktop from /etc/skel. because most of the people are not used to linux we need some special icons on the Desktop for firefox, logout and IM's. if I login to a new created account I get the right theme and the panel is like it was on the  quot;default quot; account (the account which I created the skel from) but the icons on the desktop aren't in the place where they where on the default account. They are all on the left side of the desktop and arranged in alphabetical order.  But I need them to be on  quot;fixed quot; position.  With KDE its no problem, they log in and the icons are arranged correctly.  I'm new to GNOME so maybe I just missing an option to do that.  I already tried with  quot;keep aligned quot; checked and unchecked but there is no difference. I've also tried to not use /etc/skel but copy the content from the  quot;default quot; account to the newly created.  is this even possible? does someone know where the alignment of the Desktop icons is stored?  I've made two screenshots from what I want and what I get.  I would be glad if someone could help me.  regards  jakommo </Body>
    <Summary_1>The user wanted to arrange the desktop icons in a different order other than alphabetical order was not able to do it.  With KDE, the user was able to fix the icon positions but in new GNOME, the option of arranging icon was missing. The user tried keep aligned option but was not helpful. Also, the user tried not to use /etc/skel but copied the content from the default. The user wanted to know where the alignment of the Desktop icons was stored.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to Desktop icon arrangement alphabetically in GNOME and user wants it to be fixed like in KDE. This is yet to be resolved.</Summary_2>

    <Title>Firestarter and printing sharing</Title>
    <Owner>CatMihV</Owner>
    <Body> Well, i have the following problem. I have 2 printers, an HP Laserjet 1020 and a photosmart c1300 series. Installed them, shared them, everything works ok until i launch Firestarter. When Firestarter is active the other 2 computers in the network (running winXP) can't acces them. If i turn off Firestarter they work ok but ther's no internet connection sharing. I tryed to enter lots of policies in Firestarter, opened all the ports that i saw they were used in  quot;Events quot; tab and still it doesn't work. I searched for hours on google and on forum and still didn't find a solution. If someone can help me, without unninstaling Firestarter, pls help me.  And on top of that, 1 of the computers doesn't have any trafic with the ubuntu box (that i use as a router and soon some other stuff) and i can't understand why. I removed all policies and it simply won't work, no ping no nothing. The other computer works just fine.  Thnx in advance for your help. </Body>

I installed a webserver (apache2, as instructed here: http://www.lullabot.com/videocast/in...-server-ubuntu ). Now, the 2 pc's in network can ping the server, can access the webpage but there is no net sharing. If i use Firestarter there is net sharing but the printers and the webpage can't be accessed . Should i start learning on how to make my own firewall using iptables? (Tryed kmyfirewall too, but there are some errors at launch that i couldn't find answers for them so i gave up) </Owner>

    <Body> When selecting a mirror for linux download files, is it better to select an http or a ftp server? </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> Each has pros and cons. Pick what works best for you for that mirror. Some FTP servers have resumable downloads, so if the download fails, and the FTP client allows resumption, you can pick up where you left off.  FTP has been around for ages, and was the de-facto standard for file transfer. But its command set is simplistic and rudamentary.  With the advent of the web as most know it today, FTP required users to enter ftp:// vs. http:// which they are more accustomed to. Early on, there was a lot of confusion about file types of downloaded data, and how the browser should deal with the data. As HTTP and browsers matured, downloads via HTTP have become well behaved, but it wasn't always so.  There is additional meta-data that can accompany the transfer in HTTP, and this allows some browser conveniences.  Pick the one that works best in your case, for your client. </Owner>

      <Owner> did you ever get curlftpfs working in the /etc/fstab of ubuntu?  i have tried and it fails for me. i'm not sure where /etc/fstab errors go, however when i boot up, login, i try to copy something to the alleged mount point, it's quick, like a hard drive access and mount -l doesn't show it mounted either.   this is what my entry looks like  curlftpfs#myuser:mypassword@www.webserver.com/public_html/aaa/bbb /home/user/personal fuse allow_other,rw,uid=500,user,noauto 0 0  and that doesn't work. i have to tell it a starting directory in addition to the login and password to the ftp server or else it will be storing in the incorrect directory.   is there another way to do that ? maybe my entry would work if i didn't have that extra info ?

The user was asked whether he/she did ever got curlftpfs working in the /etc/fstab of ubuntu. The other user had tried and it failed for them.  He/she was not sure where /etc/fstab errors go, however when a he/she boot up, login,  try to copy something to the alleged mount point, it was quick, like a hard drive access and mount &#8211;  the user did not observed that  mounted either.  The entry observed was as follows curlftpfs#myuser:mypassword@www.webserver.com/public_html/aaa/bbb /home/user/personal fuse allow_other,rw,uid=500,user,noauto 0 0 and that doesn't work. He had to tell it a starting directory in addition to the login and password to the ftp server or else it will be storing in the incorrect directory. The user wanted to know the solution for it and thought the entry (/public_html/aaa/bbb) would work for it. The user got it working except for one thing: his/her fstab entry looked like this curlftpfs#myuserlogin:mypassword@www.mywebsite.com/public_html /home/user/mount fuse rw,allow_other,uid=1000,user,noauto 0 0 after he/she reboot it requires a simple sudo mount /home/user/mount before anything will see it . The user was not liking a curlftpfs which cause my ~/ directory to stall upon listing or viewing the contents. nautilus or ls -al wont advance at all. The user thought that was because the mount point was inside my /home directory.  The user would change that. whatever was happening its definitely curlftpfs</Summary_1>

I don't know how or why, but the bottom right of my screen has two sets of four horizontal black bars, and the only way I know of to rid myself of them is to go into a console (alt+ctrl+F1) and come back to my KDE session. They are gone for a while, but seem to come back every-so-often.  What are these black glitches? How do I get rid of them?  I'm using a Dell Inspiron 1501 with an integrated ATI Radeon XPress on it. I'm running Kubuntu Feisty 64-bit.  Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you! </Body>

Th story goes like this:  I saw this post   http://4front-tech.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7485#7485  and as I have an X-Fi sound card in my machine I decided to give it a try. I installed the deb-package and true enough, alsatest was able to get sounds out of my X-Fi-card. Nothing else worked though, so I decided to go back my old ways, which is using the integrated sound chip of the main board in Ubuntu and the X-Fi-card when playing games in Windows. So I removed oss-linux, but then I realised I have no sound at all. System - gt; Preferences - gt; Sound does not recognize any sound card at all. Alsamixer returns this error   Code: and command    Code: returns an empty list.   Code: gives me this    Code: You can see the nForce2 AC97 sound controller there, but how to get it in use?

    <Title>Failure to boot my Serval!</Title>
    <Owner>Kaloma</Owner>
    <Body> Since yesterday (when I installed the latest Ubuntu 'edgy' kernel security update), my Serval Performance system has failed to boot several times. This problem required a hard shutdown and reboot.  The first time this occurred, I tried booting into recovery mode, which seemed to work around the issue.  The second time, even recovery mode did not work; three times I attempting to boot without success. Since I could see the boot status this time I noticed the message  quot;BUG: soft lockup on CPU#0 quot;. This did not sound very good to me.  Fortunately, I have just booted my system successfully again after flipping the wireless card switch on the chassis to the 'on' position. I had previously turned it 'off' since I was not using it at the time and had noticed an apparent CPU bug whereby one of my cores was always at 100% frequency even when not in use according to the system monitor.  Anyhow, I don't know if the switch was the cause/cure or not, because when the problem first began I still managed to boot with the switch 'off' and so far I have only had one success with it 'on'. (I need to do some important work before I can test this theory and risk not being able to boot again.)  Has anyone else heard of or experienced a similar problem?  -Matthew- </Body>
    <Comment>

      <Owner> I do have the driver version mentioned in that notice. However, neither of the files noted are missing from /usr/lib/xorg/modules. Also, my boot process was failing well before attempting to initialize X. I now reinstalled the nvidia-glx package just in case.  Since flipping the wireless card switch back to the 'on' position, I have not had this problem. I haven't yet tried switching it 'off' again to see if I can reproduce it.  Regarding the issue of one cpu core running at 100% frequency all the time, my best guess now is that it may not be related to the wireless card/driver. I have recently noticed that it the issue seems to be related to coming out of hibernation. If I boot my system fresh, I do not observe the behavior, but if I hibernate and resume then I notice it.  Many thanks to Carl and hackmeister for your help. If you happen to discover any more information about the error message I initially posted, let me know. Otherwise, I have my workaround for now.  -Matthew- </Owner>

    <Title>Spontaneous Grub breakage</Title>
    <Owner>cowbean</Owner>
    <Body> Tonight I powered up my couple-weeks-old Darter, and the Grub message that usually says something like  quot;Grub loading stage 2 quot;, it just said  quot;Grub  quot; with a blinking cursor after it. Ctrl-Alt-Del wouldn't reboot, turning off and back on via the power button resulted in the same screen.  I followed this thread's instructions to reinstall Grub, and now everything seems peachy.  My question is, what might cause spontaneous grub breakage like this? I had shutdown normally last time the computer was operational. Is this an indication that there is a physical defect with the hard drive?  As a precaution I am carrying around the Ubuntu CD in case I need to install grub again. </Body>

      <Owner> The annoying part is that the only posts I can find about this issue only show up as problems with XGL. But I have an NVidia card, so I'm using THAT codepath. I think this happens each time I've installed Gutsy and done a dist-upgrade (since Alpha 1); does nobody else have this issue? No GeForce 8600's in the house? </Owner>

Desktop effects are working, success! Run - gt; gnome-terminal  # glxgears  Desktop resets back to login screen. WTF is going on here?! Am I seriously the only person dealing with this?!  gt;_ lt; ANGER. Mind you, this is still on the Tribe5 LiveCD. </Owner>

      <Owner> well a cube has 6 sides... do you mean to have a separate cube? or more like a pentahexahedron type of thing? or just to have all 6 sides including top  amp; bottom show a desktop instead of just the 4 sides? </Owner>

    <Title>7.10 Compiz-fusion window size problem</Title>
    <Owner>TubaTodd</Owner>
    <Body> I just installed Ubuntu 7.10 last night and everything went very well. My only problem is that I can't seem to get Compiz fusion to agree on the proper screen width. My laptop has a 1280x800 lcd screen. I have an Acer 22 quot; (1680x1050) widescreen monitor plugged into the laptop full-time (I don't use the laptop LCD at all).   When running off the Live CD and after hard disk installation, I noticed that when desktop effects are enabled (compiz-fusion) that ALL windows open pinned to the upper left hand corner. If I hit maximize, the screen enlarges but only to a 1280x800 sized window. If I drag the window to the center of the screen and maximize it, it stretches to the full with of my 1680x1050 screen. Unfortunately, the second I click anywhere on that window, it resizes back to the 1280x800 resolution again.   So far, my only fix was to disable desktop effects. All windows act properly WITHOUT desktop effects turned on. BTW, when I had Feisty installed (using the very same xorg.conf file and everything) compiz-fusion worked GREAT!!! I just installed compiz-fusion using these instructions.  http://forlong.blogage.de/article/20...-Ubuntu-Feisty  Any ideas on what is causing this?  Oh yeah....my laptop does NOT support dual monitors nor does the new screen amp;graphics application let me configure more than 1 screen for use. </Body>

System - gt; Preference - gt; Advanced Desktop Effects Settings - gt; General Options - gt; Display Settings  4. Uncheck  quot;Detect Outputs quot;  5. Modify  quot;Outputs quot; as  quot;1680x1050+0+0 quot;  6. System - gt; Preference - gt; Appearance - gt; Visual Effects - gt; Custom  7. Reboot.  If it helps you, please let me know.  I have still problem with dual monitor probelm. With the configuration, it does not allow to select secondary display. Anyway, I wish this would help you. </Owner>

      <Owner> I also have this problem with the Gutsy Live CD - I have an Intel 945GM graphics chip hooked up by VGA to an HDTV as my only monitor. I know that my HDTV spews out 1024x768 as the highest supported resolution to the x.org log, but the xserver-xorg-video-intel driver package thingy correctly feeds 1280x768 to my HDTV anyway for proper unstretched fullscreen HDTV goodness. With compiz enabled, when I maximize, all the windows only expand to 1024 pixels wide.  My point with all the above is to ask if compiz takes settings from the x.org log? If so that is silly, and could the resolution data be taken from ubuntu's screen resolution dialog config file as that gives the correct resolution of 1280x768? Should I stick this data into a bug report?  I will try this solution once I have installed gutsy to my hard drive, hoping it works for me too.  Phil </Owner>

    <Body> So I got AWN and Emerald to try out the new osx theme...and I have a few questions.  Emerald- I have the emerald theme manager but when I try to apply a theme nothing happens...I double click, and nothing happens. I tried downloading a new theme and the same thing happend. I imported it, and double clicked. (nothing happend, lol.)  AWN- I cant seem to get firefox or any other applett/launcher to work with AWN besides the ones that came with it. I drag and drop on the bar, on the awn manager screen, anywhere....and nothing happens, lol.  Thanks for the help, hopefully I can get this to fully work, lol. </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> The theme manager doesn't load emerald when started, you have to run 'emerald --replace' to have it replace your current running window decorator. Just make a shortcut/launcher, or add it to Sessions if you want it started upon logging in.  Can't help you with AWN though. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user had the AWN and Emerald theme manager. The user had problems with emerald theme manager as he/she was neither able to apply the theme nor download the theme. The user was not able to run firefox or any applett/launcher with AWN. The user tried to drag and drop on the bar, on the AWN manager screen but nothing happened. The user needed to replace emerald with emerald--replace to solve the problem. The user observed that the windows border disappeared. The user needed to add some stuff to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf, should help. In the "Screen" section: Code: to solve the problem. This worked for Nvidia cards. The other user wanted to know about gtk mac themes. gtk mac themes were available on Mac4Lin's amazing Leopard Transformation http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=555373</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>The discussion is in regard to AWN and Emerald theme managers to apply the new osx theme and not working. This can be resolved as following: As the theme manager doesn't load emerald when started, and have to run 'emerald --replace' to have it replace the current running window decorator. Just make a shortcut/launcher, or add it to Sessions to start upon logging in and an ampersand (&amp;) after any command to make it run in the background but this makes the window borders go away. To work perfectly the user should restart the system. For AWN related it is resolved yet. And for gtk Mac themes there is Mac4Lin's amazing Leopard Transformation Pack and for anything "Mac" related there is a seperate discussion thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=555373</Summary_2>

    <Title>Compiz-Fusion binding problem</Title>
    <Owner>AdHavoc</Owner>
    <Body> I recently installed Compiz-Fusion (the CCCM) in Ubuntu 7.10 and everything works great, but I have a question. For some reason, every time I use the right click button, it activates some effect where all of the virtual desktops are spread out on a single line. I cannot find the setting for this, so I am unable to right click on anything, which is quite annoying. Also, is there some way to zoom out farther in the Desktop Cube setting when rotating the cube?  Thanks. </Body>

      <Owner> While we wait for more information, if you ever want to start something in a terminal and you don't want it to terminate upon closing the terminal itself, just add an ampersand ( amp; sign) after the command to make it run in the background.   Code: You can then terminate the process either by invoking kill and supplying the PID number that was output upon running the command itself (right after gedit there in that example), or by calling killall gedit (or whatever the name was of the command you ran). Do note that if you have several processes with the same name, all with get terminated. Hence, killall. </Owner>

    <Title>Partition Rodeo Question</Title>
    <Owner>oldtug</Owner>
    <Body> First off, finally took the leap and installed 9.04 in my badly bloated Dell Insperon 600m in its own partition of about 9.5MB. Things seem to be running fine on the Ubuntu side. (A bit like stepping off the boat onto an new undiscovered land)   I now want to wipe the XP partition and do a clean XP install, and at same time divide the total HD capacity between the 2 systems.  What is the best practice to follow? I don't want to (if I don't have to) reinstall 9.04.   If I use the XP install disk will that wipe ALL partitions on disk, including 9.04, or just the XP side of things? Or is there a method that works using the live 9.04 disk.  Thanks  Eric in Seattle  PS: I'm starting to enjoy the feeling of removing myself from the M*M*I*C! (microsoft mac industrial complex) </Body>

    <Title>3 LARGE errors in Ubuntu 8.10- Shutdown, Screen Flicker, Random Desktops Flashing</Title>
    <Owner>BastardNamban</Owner>
    <Body> I am posting this for a friend, who needs some help. He doesn't have an account here yet.  3 Major problems with his 8.10 Intrepid install-   1. His desktop is randomly changing every so many seconds, not regularly, between 2 backgrounds. The main one stays up, and flashes to the same other one for a couple seconds, then returns. I can't figure out why.  2. Most annoying- computer refuses to shut down! Going to shutdown supposedly shuts down the computer, no activity, but bumping the mouse restarts it. He can't shut it down without hitting the physical switch. I am not hitting hibernate by accident- this is for real.  3. Gave him Gstreamer XINE to watch DVDs finally, and it worked, but the same problem he had before keeps occuring- the media player output now reads the DVD, plays and all, but it keeps flickering to black fast, making the movie unwatchable, even though you can tell it is playing fine otherwise.  Ideas? We're headed out to dinner now, I'll check back in a few hours. </Body>

      <Owner> Forgive me, I try NOT to be a help vampire. But I myself am not extremely knowledgeable on ubuntu, as I'm self taught myself.   Quote:  well, this is going to sound snarky any way I say it after posting that, but I'm sorry, can you give precise  amp; detailed account of what exactly  quot;live run mode quot; is, and what the memtest function is?  Before you shoot back at me, I admit to not knowing a lot. I can google these things endlessly, and get it maybe, or someone like you who seems to know could have explained it simply and what to do/how to access it for me, and helped teach me, to get a quicker answer, spared me endless googling for one helpful page. I still don't know what  quot;live-run mode quot; is or what that has to do with all this. I'm sorry.  Specs: I was specific with Ubuntu (gnome interface 2.24.1) 8.10, Intrepid, kernel 2.6.27-14. This is the sole OS installed, no windows, no dual boot. My friend supposedly had a guru put all this on for him that I've never met, and from what I can tell, he put a lot of stuff on that my friend neither uses or knows of. And the movie thing flashing to black happened after the guru last touched this, he says. I'm thinking the supposed guru knows even less about what he's doing than I do, and I don't know much myself.  He has AWN installed as well as compiz settings manager (2 things that often seem to give issues to other people's computers, I noticed, which is why I mention them), and I've already tried running through the shutdown preferences and workarounds tab in compiz to see if I could find an things that might be causing these. I turned off legacy screen support in workarounds, still nothing.  The mouse that upon moving wakes up the shutdown computer is a Toshiba 3 button mouse, red light. From what I can tell, he's running a custom rig of some sort that looks old. I'm not even sure if he knows what he has. He left it all to his guru I never met.  Lastly, I looked for a hardware list and did this  Code: .  Here's what I got (could it be a graphics card issue?)  Code: And yes I realize that's cut off- I don't know how to get the top part, the terminal erases it before I can see it since the thing is all so long. Sorry.  I know this is probably not enough to diagnose, but I don't know where to start or what else you need to know. Honestly, I'm thinking of wiping his computer and just reinstalling 8.04 and building it for him personally, as I understand that, I feel.  Does anything here help? </Owner>

      <Owner> A for effort!  The Ubuntu disk should be a live-run CD AND it will also have memtest on it as well as the installer.  Put the disk in the machine and have the machine boot from the disk  you should see a screen with some different selections  one of the selections will be to  quot;try ubuntu without changing anything quot;  that is your live-run so please select  quot;try ubuntu quot; and allow the system to load  now experiment to see how a  quot;straight ubuntu install quot; would work </Owner>

      <Owner> Ok, thanks for the feedback. Unfortunately for now, I have to get home- I am visiting my friend's place today, and he lives far away from me. I don't have time now to try any of this- today. I'll have to come back sometime next week or something.  It looks like this could be an issue with his graphics card then?  I don't have a live disk here, he doesn't either. I'll have to burn one when I get home. He's using Intrepid, but would this issue be fixed on a newer release if I installed one (ie: Jaunty)? </Owner>

      <Owner> Turn off desktop effects when you want to play video. ATI's driver has the flickering problem when you have desktop effects AND you play video or use an OpenGL program at the same time.  ATI doesn't seem to want to fix the problem  Get an Nvidia card if possible as it doesn't have this issue. </Owner>

      <Owner> Ah- That's a big 10-4 on that. I'm not at his place, but I don't remember him having desktop effects enabled- I think I came across that. I'll relay it to him though.  Honestly, we can apologize for people who code anyday, saying it's hard, the problem was just found, etc., but if this has been a known problem for some time and they don't care to fix it, that's atrocious. I see why Nvidia is so prevalent now under linux. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user faced 3 major problems with his 8.10 intrepid install. 1 The desktop kept randomly changing at every so many seconds but not regularly between 2 backgrounds. 2 The computer refuses to shut down. Shut down supposedly shuts down the computer, no activity but bumping the mouse restarts it. The user was not hitting the hibernate. 3 Gstreamer Xine was used to watch DVD which worked initially but the media player output now reads the DVD plays and all but it kept flickering to black fast, making the movie unwatchable. The problem can be tested my operating system in the live-run mode. The result of the memtest function of memory of the live run should be helpful. The Ubuntu disk should be a live-run CD AND it would also have memtest on it as well as the installer. Put the disk in the machine and have the machine boot from the disk you should see a screen with some different selections one of the selections will be to "try ubuntu without changing anything" that is a live-run so please select "try ubuntu" and allow the system to load now experiment to see how a "straight ubuntu install" would work. The problem can be due to the graphics card. The other solution was to uninstall wallpaper-tray from the synaptic.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to 3 errors with 8.10 Intrepid install in Ubuntu 8.10. The 3 problems are as follows: 1. User is experiencing screen flickering randomly. 2. The system is refusing to shut down without hitting the physical switch and 3. Gstearmer Xine media player output reads the DVD and keeps flickering and making the video unwatchable. This can be resolved if the the user run Ubuntu disk should be a live-run CD and getting a 9.04 disk from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=611492 correct the issues. ATI's driver has the flickering problem when the desktop effects and play video or use an OpenGL program at the same time. Perhaps, this can be a graphics card issue that can be resolved using Nvidia card rather than ATI.</Summary_2>

    <Title>[SOLVED] The old guitar learning sofware question!</Title>
    <Owner>Dutch70</Owner>
    <Body> I see this question has been ask a hundred times, but I can't find an answer that suits me.   I have been playing for about a year, so I know how to read tabliture...ha! just dont know how to spell it! lol, anyway, I want something that is open source. Not so much because it is free,(I'm sure there are good programs cheap) but thats not the point, it's because of the spirit of open source. I hope to one day get rid of all non-free crap on my PC.  anybody, any and all answers are welcome and appreciated, just looking for opinions here.  Dutch </Body>

      <Owner> oh darn it, just got a good look at it, and I would bet that it is awesome for a real musician, but I just want something simple, I will check it out more, but just lookin at it, seems more complex than the guitar itself. On the other hand, my nephew is an awesome up and coming musician, and I am sure he will love it. can't wait to show him. he's been playin about 15 years, written some songs that I really like. </Owner>

      <Owner> i say stick with tux guitar - its helping me learn (though i know it looks complex). get some power tabs from here http://www.guitarprotabs.org/, double click them and they'll open in tux. if they dont, right click them and select 'open with'.   the lines in tux represent the guitar strings, and the numbers what fret to put your finger on.   you can even press the play button and have tux play the song to you!  im just learning to play too, and i say tuxguitar is worth investing time in.   see also this website  http://www.justinguitar.com/  no software, but some youtube based video lessons.   good luck! </Owner>

      <Owner> Torrent some guitar instructional videos by Paul Gilbert. I learned a lot from those . Or you could just search them on YouTube. There are a lot of amateur instructional videos out there which could also be song specific.  Also, stick to Tuxguitar as it is good software released under GPL. Just look for .gp# files for the particular songs that you like. I sometimes print out the tabs so I wouldn't have to open my machine everytime I want to study them. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user wanted to know the guitar learning software which has open source. Tuxguitar was available software to read powertabs and guitar pro tabs. It can be downloaded from the tuxguitar website. It was also available in Synaptic from where it can be sudo. Some other different guitar programs can be downloaded to sourceforge.net. The user also needed information about the websites which teach to play a song, chords and tab without making too much to read. Tux guitar software seemed to be good learning software for learning guitar as the some power tabs downloaded from guitarprotabs can be openend in Tux guitar. Tux guitar can play music. There are some websites like justinguitar.com which has video lessons. The user needed a song called more than a memory to work on tuxguitar. Guitar chords galore,http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/top/top100.htm and http://www.chordie.com/ can be used to download the songs. Advanced search can also be useful. Torrent has some guitar instructional videos by Paul Gilbert. Youtube has lot of amateur instructional videos which could be also song specific.</Summary_1>

For good sites where someone can look up how to play a song, chords, tabs can stick with tux guitar and can fer some power tabs from get some power tabs from here http://www.guitarprotabs.org/, double click them and they will open in tux. if they dont, right click  and select 'open with'. the lines in tux represent the guitar strings, and the numbers what fret to put finger on.

    <Comment>
      <Owner> boot windows into safe mode so it uses the generic drivers for your keyboard and mouse rather than any fancy ones you may have.  Lets be honest, this isn't really anything to do with ubuntu.  You should also have either the packet/sticky label with your product code on if it's genuine. </Owner>

It is to do with ubuntu though because i'm using it for data recovery. Safe mode isn't an option most likely due to conflicting drivers or a registry corruption (This is my friends machine). Ive run  lt;code gt;chkdsk /r lt;/code gt; in recovery console (Windows)and still no joy so now i'm looking to ubuntu for solutions. </Owner>

      <Owner> If that doesnt work have a look at the following post:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=955950  You can edit the windows registry by downloading the MiTEc file onto your ubuntu partition:-  http://www.soft411.com/company/MiTeC...ile-Viewer.htm  Once downloaded mount your windows partition as read-write (or read only if you dont want to make any changes, then run the MiTec program with wine. You need to point it to the mount point, and then to the windows registry: e.g. /media/sda1/WINDOWS/system32/config/software  The software hive will have your prodct key open Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion and then use google to convert it from ProductID to ProductKey  Edit: Just tried this and it looks as though you cannot delete or edit any registry keys or folders. I have write permission but there appears to be no way to make any changes. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user needed the information to retrieve the Windows XP product key from a dual boot machine. The windows had mouse/keyboard driver issues so user was unable to use it. The user wanted to retrieve windows key through ubuntu if possible. The mouse/keyboard problem could be solved by booting windows into a safe mode and using the generic drivers for a keyboard and mouse. This problem was not connected to ubuntu. The product key should be available on the packet or sticky label of windows if the windows was genuine. The user does not have an OEM sticker on the machine. The user believed that the problem has to do with ubuntu as he/she was using it for data recovery. The user also observed that the safe mode wasn't an option most likely due to conflicting drivers or a registry console (Windows). The user can run wine as the computer has dual booting system but as the user's windows does not held in wine drive, it was not helpful. The other user had suggested to follow the steps given on the following post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=955950 The user can edit the windows registry by downloading the MiTEc file onto an ubuntu partition:- http://www.soft411.com/company/MiTeC...ile-Viewer.htm Once downloaded mount a windows partition as read-write (or read only if a user dont want to make any changes, then run the MiTec program with wine. The user need to point it to the mount point, and then to the windows registry: e.g. /media/sda1/WINDOWS/system32/config/software The software hive will have your prodct key open Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion and then use google to convert it from ProductID to ProductKey Edit: Just tried this and it looks as though user cannot delete or edit any registry keys or folders.  The user has write permission but there appears to be no way to make any changes. The other way is to try the ultimate boot CD for windows to ge a keyboard up and running. More information can be obtained from the webpage http://www.majorgeeks.com/UBCD4Win_d5710.html</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This question is in regard to Windows XP product key from dual boot machine. The OEM sticker is no longer on the machine and user would like to use current legal product key for the reinstall. It is to do with ubuntu though because user using it for data recovery. Safe mode isn't an option most likely due to conflicting drivers or a registry corruption. The solution provided is partial from  http://magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/ as the user is unable to use mouse or keyboard when in Windows and that tool is in Windows only. User should be able to run it in wine but real windows hive is not held in wine drive so it will be looking in the wrong place. The other solutions provided are in the following post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=955950 user can edit the windows registry by downloading the MiTEc file onto ubuntu partition:- http://www.soft411.com/company/MiTeC...ile-Viewer.htm Once downloaded mount  windows partition as read-write (or read only if user dont want to make any changes, then run the MiTec program with wine.

    <Title>Kernel Panic - VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0)</Title>
    <Owner>kesre</Owner>
    <Body> Hi   I recently got Ubuntu (Ibex) and I started noticing that if I left the computer on for long periods of time (overnight) in the morning, the screen would freeze with just the Desktop image displaying.  now, I know that when the system freezes you want it to shutdown 'gracefully' unfortunately, Ubuntu does not recognize my keyboard's SySrq key. The key is [FN] + delete. However, it is recognized as  quot;prt sc quot; (as is the actual prt sc) I have a compaq presario V6000, 88 keys, 101 compatible... and so on.   Usually when I hard reset, the computer is fine, however, now I get Code:  1.484036 RAMDisk: Compressed image found at block 0 1.890479 - list of all partitions: 1.890536 No filesystem could mount root, tried: cramfs 1.891310 Kernel Panic - not syncing:VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0)  I assume this is due to not being able to use Alt + Sysrq R,E,I,S,U,B - so the disk doesn't sync...  If you can help me on any one of these parts, I would greatly appreciate it (though I think I'll need to be able to startup Ubuntu to troubleshoot the 2nd and 1st Parts...  Thanks in advance </Body>

    <Summary_1>The user recently got Ubuntu (Ibex) and was experiencing a problem in which the screen would freeze if the computer was left unused for long period of time. Whenever the computer got freeze, the Ubuntu does not recognized the keyboard's SySrq key. The key was [FN]+delete. The computer was able to recognize it as prt sc. The user had a compaq presario V6000, 88 keys, 101 compatible.  Whenever user did hard reset, the computer was fine but however when the user code:1.484036 RAMDisk: Compressed image found at block 0 1.890479 - list of all partitions: 1.890536 No file system could mount root, tried: cramfs 1.891310 Kernel Panic - not syncing:VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0). The user assumed the problem was due to not being able to use Alt + Sysrq R,E,I,S,U,B - so the disk doesn't synchronize. The solution to the problem is to boot the system into older kernel which can be done just after bios boot, select kernel anme with lower number in grub menu. The other problem observed was when the user boot from the latest kernel, after the normal scrolling of stuff starting up the screen shows the previous error data, then clears the screen and prints (paraphrased) - Boot from ext3, starting up... then Code: Then the whole "VFS: Unable to mount" thing  The other user had a similar problem. The user had the linux mint which was a clean install and was not able to access linux. The user had an access to linux partition but can&#8217;t use any command from linux. The peculiar bug was present which made boot folder repeat itself lot of times or something. The trick of using a previous kernel worked with Linux version 2.6.27-11-generic (buildd@vernadsky) (gcc version 4.3.2 (Ubuntu 4.3.2-1ubuntu11) #1 SMP Wed Apr 1 20:57:48 UTC 2009. The kernel version which had troubles was Linux version 2.6.27-14-generic (buildd@palmer) (gcc version 4.3.2 (Ubuntu 4.3.2-1ubuntu12) ) #1 SMP Wed Apr 15 18:59:16 UTC 2009 (Ubuntu 2.6.27-14.33-generic). The following messages observed were bad gzip image and magic number.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to unable to mount roof fs on unknown-block (0,0). The user keyboard is unable to recognize by Ubuntu (Ibex) which runs from live cd after the computer is ON for long periods of time and the system is freeze only "prt sc" is working in the keyboard. This can be resolved by trying to boot into older kernel with select kernel name with lower number in grub menu. This is work around than a solution. The user kernel is 2.6.27-11 is working fine after some updates.</Summary_2>

I had just formated a new partition of it to reiserfs and needed to make it very accessible (on all my systems without exception). I therefore entered the chmod 777 command. The intention was to do it in the local folder, but it was late and I was tired.  So assuming that I actually have only changed the permissions in  quot;/ quot;...  How can I change it back?

      <Owner> Thank you sisco311. Disaster has been averted. Turns out that I had only managed to change the read permission of / therefore the first command you suggested worked like a charm.  For all posters out there that suggest to reinstall as soon as they see the numbers 777: read up or shut up. And read the sticky of this section:  gt; gt; Telling people to reinstall for every issue is not acceptable.  lt; lt; I saved an awful lot of time by asking the right questions and not rushing to the solution. I'm no linux expert but thankfully I had the right feeling about this one.  I hope this thread will help someone in the future.  Thanks to everyone. </Owner>

      <Owner> To justify myself: as stated I was tired and did make a mistake. However, to expect that a linux intermediate user (let's call them normal users) is supposed to know exactly what they execute in the terminal is not viable, mainly because irc, these forums and many other pages give lists of commands, usually to solve problems, that the users will go and execute blindfolded. They trust these commands because they do not understand enough of the problem to solve it themselves and have been advised to do so by a person.  To justify your answer: Linux users that open up a terminal should indeed know a short list of the no-no commands. I know what the chmod 777 command does in principle and avoid it like the plague, however in this case it was supposed to be run for an external HD. Again, it was my mistake. I should have been more careful.  A more neutral comment: Independently of carelessness of users or help-posters (whether it was for executing a command without thinking twice, or not reading the full post, analysing it carefully and then giving advice), I believe that the forums are a great resource for information and help. If this experience has taught me anything (and not the hard way, thankfully, this time) it is that I can wait and have a bit more patience and seek second opinions when it comes to deciding on an answer to solve the problem... and not execute sudo chmod 777 in root, of course.  Thank you all. </Owner>

    <Owner>brendanodork</Owner>
    <Body> Hola!  I've got a laptop (Compaq V2000) that's been running ubuntu (Hardy) nicely out of the box. I tried to get fancy and install the ati video drivers for it so that i could get svideo out to my TV. Got it working for a while (downloaded from the ATI site), was playing around with many different settings trying to get it to work the way i wanted it. I didn't keep particularly good track of what i was doing and at some point, the laptop started booting into what it calmly and repetitively informs me is Low Graphics Mode because it cannot detect my defice. So that's sad. At some point in there i upgraded to Intrepid. :-/ Too many upgrades at once - i know i shouldn't have.  I tried all of the  quot;fix me quot; options in Recovery Mode. I tried replacing /etc/X11/xorg.conf with a few different ones, including a very empty-looking one, and the one that results when i type  quot;sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p high xserver-xorg quot;. I replaced it with one that was (i believe) marked  quot;xorg.conf.original quot; from recovery mode, and that worked very nicely...once. When i rebooted, back to low graphics mode. Further replacements do not seem to be yielding me any results.  Does this sound familiar to anyone? Is there a diagnostic path that seems useful to someone? I was next going to try making a live CD to make sure it really was my system that was borked rather than the hardware parts.  Thanks! - Brendan </Body>
    <Summary_1>The user had a laptop (Compaq V2000) that's been running ubuntu (Hardy) properly.The user tried to install the ati video drivers so that he/she could get svideo out to a TV. Got it working for a while (downloaded from the ATI site), was playing around with many different settings trying to get it to work the way the user wanted it. The user  didn't keep particularly good track of what he/she was doing and at some point, the laptop started booting into what it calmly and repetitively informs the user is Low Graphics Mode because it cannot detect the user's device. At some point in there the user  upgraded to Intrepid. :-/ Too many upgrades at once - i know i shouldn't have. The user tried all of the "fix me" options in Recovery Mode. The user tried replacing /etc/X11/xorg.conf with a few different ones, including a very empty-looking one, and the one that results when the user typed "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p high xserver-xorg". The user replaced it with one that was marked "xorg.conf.original" from recovery mode, and that worked very nicely once. When the user rebooted, it was back to low graphics mode.  The user wanted to know useful diagnostic path for this problem. The user was next going to try making a live CD to make sure it really was his/her system that was borked rather than the hardware parts.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to after installing the ATI video drivers to get svideo out by that time sysyem started booting and went to a Low Graphice Mode. Further, on  replacing /etc/X11/xorg.conf with a  "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p high xserver-xorg" and one marked with "xorg.conf.original" from recovery mode, resolved for once. But upon rebooted, back to low graphics mode. This is yet to be resolved.</Summary_2>

    <Title>Take off Windows? How to?</Title>
    <Owner>Budd Manlove</Owner>
    <Body> I finished installing Ubuntu and I think it's about time that I get this crap Windows off of here. The registry in Windows is pretty messed up... beyond repair. Almost half of the Windows functions do not work (my fault so I won't go blaming any imaginary little brother of mine).   Is there a way I can remove Windows fully without killing my computer? </Body>

      <Owner> You could technically download the GParted Live-CD, burn it, then boot it. You can grab the Live-CD right here http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php. If you already have Ubuntu installed, which I'm assuming you do, you need to find the NTFS or FAT32 partitions, delete those partitions, then resize your ext3 partition to your liking. Now if you don't already have Ubuntu installed, you can always pop in the Ubuntu Live-CD and select  quot;Guided Partition: Use entire disk quot; and that will just install Ubuntu over Windows, it's really your choice. </Owner>

      <Owner> I already have Ubuntu installed and when I was trying to find info on how to do this before making this thread, I kept finding all this info about partitions. Now, I'm kind of a n00b when it comes to installing another entire OS. Where I'm going with that is... I have no idea what a partition is or where to find it.   So with Ubuntu already installed, I just need to find the two partitions stated above and delete them? Where do I find them and how far should I expand the remaining one? </Owner>

      <Owner> Can you please post the results of this command?  Code: Once I or someone else has seen that command, we can help you further. If you do not know what a partition is, I recommend you reading this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning. You need to find the NTFS or FAT32 partition, once you download the GParted Live-CD. Then you have the option to delete the NTFS/FAT32 partition and resize your ext3 partition to what you want. Another thing you can do is once your in the GParted Live-CD take a screenshot and again I or someone else can help you further. </Owner>

      <Owner> Do you have two hard disks? There's no sign of Ubuntu on sda1.  It appears the NTFS partition you deleted was a primary partition, and somehow gparted was unable to create a good partition table after you deleted it. </Owner>

      <Owner> Well, it looks like you have deleted your windows partition, but I didn't see any linux partition in your fdisk output. How did you install ubuntu? Did you use wubi to start the installation from within windows? In that case ubuntu was installed within your windows partition, which means it is gone now. You need to install ubuntu again.  The other partitions on your hard drive seem to be dell's utility partition and some dell restore partition. I guess the restore partition can be used to restore windows, so you may want to keep it in case you decide you need windows, unless you have a real windows install cd and a valid licence... If you want to keep those partitions, just let ubuntu use the rest of the space on the hard drive without touching the other partitions. If you don't want to keep them, make sure you remove them before you start to install ubuntu, and just let the ubuntu installer use the entire hard drive. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user wanted to remove Windows as he/she installed Ubuntu from the system. The registry of the windows was beyond repair. The user could technically download the GParted Live-CD, burn it, then boot it. The user can get information from the website http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php. Since the Ubuntu was installed, the user need to find the NTFS or FAT32 partitions, need to delete those partitions, then resize an ext3 partition according to the requirement.   The user was recommended to read the webpage http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning. to know about the partition and was asked to post the results of the command. The results of the code were as below -------------------------------- Disk /dev/sda: 58.5 GB, 58506416640 bytes 255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 7113 cylinders, total 114270345 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Disk identifier: 0xe686f016 Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System /dev/sda1 63 96389 48163+ de Dell Utility /dev/sda2 * 96390 104310044 52106827+ 7 HPFS/NTFS /dev/sda4 104310045 114254279 4972117+ db CP/M / CTOS / ... --------------------------------  From the code it was identified as NTFS partition so the user was asked to look for NTFS partition in GParted and the user was also requested to provide the screenshot for further assistance. The user tried to take a screenshot but was not able to find the location, where it was saved. The user tried to delete the NTFS partition and following message was observed. /dev/sda1 fat16 DellUtility Size=47.03MiB Used=7.86MiB Unused=37.17MiB unallocated unallocated Size=46.69GiB Used=-- Unused=-- /dev/sda4 fat32 DellRestore Size=4.74GiB Used=4.49GiB Unused=261.11MiB unallocated unallocated Size=7.84MiB Used=-- Unused=-- So restart.... "Invalid or damaged Bootable Partition. The user had deleted the primary partition which had windows in it and the linux partition was not visible in the fdisk output. The user needs to reinstall ubuntu. The user was suggested to keep the recovery partition as it can be use to restore windows and was suggested to remove other partitions.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to an already installed Ubuntu and have to remove Windows by finding and deleting the partitions. Based on the command line code its an NTFS partition and the screenshot of GParted Live-CD looks like the user resolved it by deleting NTFS partition in otherwords windows.</Summary_2>

      <Owner> so, system got spontaneously buggy? from my experience, linux systems don't do that, and if there's nothing else to remember and identify as possible cause I'll just press the restart button and wait for a reboot, if you get trouble booting/logging then we could discuss, but before pressing the restart button try just restarting the x-server by pressing ctrl+alt+backspace, anyway, that's just what I would do. </Owner>

    <Owner>lordofduct</Owner>
    <Body> Ok for starters I'm running two X screens right now.  That is two independent screens on which I can NOT drag stuff back and forth between the two, the monitors are two different sizes and resolutions so I can't stretch across nicely.  I use my main monitor for work, programming, and general stuff. Yes I'm slightly new to Unix.  My left monitor is for multimedia and minor things. It's where I open up Rhythmbox and Pidgin. If I want to watch a movie while working I put it on the left monitor. All that little stuff.  The thing is this also means that my remote control is usually controlling something on my left monitor as well. But it is used for MythTv on the main monitor (it's the larger of the two at 30 inches, yey TV).      SOOOOOO  my question.  I'm configuring lirc to open up and control rhythmbox.  my config file for test purposes looks like this so far:   Code: Just a few basic commands.  The thing is it only starts rhythmbox on the main screen, and the play or pause commands only work IF rhythmbox is on the main screen. If I manually open it on the left one, and push buttons, rhythmbox never receives the commands.  What can I do to direct it over to the left screen???? </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> i'm assuming it's something to do with what I type in the  quot;config quot; command or something... err, not sure...  is there a way in a terminal window to select which screen a graphical app opens? I know the screen numbers of each X display. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user had problem with the kubuntu while reading and mounting drives. For the NTFS partitions access, NTFS3G package installation is required. In spite of NTFS-3g installation, the user was not able to access the ntfs drives through dolphin. The selected item reverts to root or home. The user felt that it can be a permission problem</Summary_1>

    <Body> I want Evolution to use my gmail contacts as an online address book. I tried following the guide here. However when I go to use the address book I get this error:  Quote: I have tried googling for answers and searching here. I have not been able to find anything.  I can import contacts as v-cards for now.  Everything else connects just fine - Gmail imap, and Google Calendar -still can't see repeating events though - some day right </Body>

      <Owner> Hi andyanderso,  the same problem here. I'm not able to sync Evolution with Googlemail contacts (for legal issues GMail is termed Googlemail here in Germany).  Sometimes i get the same error you mentioned and from time to time a SEG FAULT occurs...  It happens on a 32-bit Intrepid as well as on a 64-bit system...  evolution 2.24.3-0ubuntu1 evolution-data-server 2.24.3-0ubuntu1 </Owner>

      <Owner> I just tried it tonight for the first time following the guide and it worked fine. Thanks for the tip. Ubuntu 8.10, Evolution 2.24.3. We run inside Google Apps for domain.  However, I do have a problem that seems to be recognized in your posts as well and that is with the calendar.  I can see SOME of my events on my calendar inside Evolution but not all and certainly not repeating. I do get to see events that I have been invited to by colleagues too...pretty funny that some public events show and others don't.  Any suggestions anyone? Evolution would clearly be my choice but I live on my calendar app.  Thanks in advance. </Owner>

      <Owner> I'm using evo 2.26.1. Syncing with google calendar is flawless. When I sync with gmail contacts, however, (using this guide: http://www.linux.com/news/software/a...ogles-pim-apps) I get full name field and nothing else even though my gmail contacts are fully filled out.  Any ideas? </Owner>

      <Owner> thought i might add my 2 cents to this: for you guys who've gotten this to work, does evolution sync with 'all contacts' in gmail?  mine does this, but it's not ideal, i'd rather get it to sync with 'my contacts' so that it doesn't store addresses of every single person i've emailed...  any thoughts? </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user wanted Evolution to use his/her gmail contacts as an online address book. The user tried following the guide but when the user used the address book, error was observed. The user was able to import contacts as v-card but was not able to use Gmail imap and Google Calendar. The user tried finding a solution from google but was unable to find it. The other user also had the same problem. The user was not able to synchronize the Evolution with Google mail contacts and observed the same error. The problem was observed on 32-bit Intrepid as well as on a 64-bit system with evolution 2.24.3-0ubuntu1 evolution-data-server 2.24.3-0ubuntu1 One of the users followed the guide and it worked for him/her. The user had ubuntu 8.10, evolution 2.24.3. The user had a problem with the recognization of the post and calendar. The user observed some of the events on the calendar inside the Evolution but not all and certainly not repeating. Some of the shared events were observed but not some were missing inside the Evolution. One of the users thought that it was not ideal to synchronize evolution with all contacts but it would be better to synchronize it with my contacts so that it doesn&#8217;t store addresses of every email contact.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to problems syncing gmail contacts as an online address book with Evolution. Perhaps, upgrading to Evolution 2.26.1 resolves the syncing with google contacts, google calendars etc.</Summary_2>

      <Owner> Howdy,  in terminal, type sudo gparted  if its not installed, type   sudo apt-get install gparted  gparted can wipe any type of partition and with relative ease. just make sure you do wipe the partition you intend to, as you can fubar your drive if you get rid of the wrong thing.  Hope this helps, and definitely ask more questions if you aren't sure this is what you want and what you are doing. </Owner>

      <Owner> wow, thats a ton of partitions, crazy thats how they come.   I would remove all partitions that arent the XP partition, then extend the xp partition to fill the space after it, and install ubuntu on the other side of the drive.  BUT, not sure if once you remove those partitions you'll be able to boot into xp till you get ubuntu installed and it installs grub for boot loading, so once you do the next step, be ready to roll.  Also, it may tell you it cant remove partitions when in the OS, and if so, boot into the ubuntu live cd and deal with it from there. </Owner>

      <Owner> sda2 looks to be it. The other ntfs partition is likely a recovery partition for XP.  If you want to make sure, boot into XP, use XP's partition manager to see what size and format your XP partition is- and more than likely its NTFS and around the size of sda2. </Owner>

      <Owner> Yup, right click my computer, click manage, then on left pane click disc management. Not as full featured as gparted, but it shows the same drive labels you see when you are in the my computer screen, so you'll be able to verify wich is wich.  It wont let you extend the drive to fill the space, but it will let you delete partitions at least. </Owner>

If you want to do it before hand, you can use gparted to do it before, but really thats no faster or better (no good reason to not just let ubuntu do it during install.

    <Summary_1>How to wipe ubuntu partition? The user is currently having dual booting with easy peasy and XP and is facing problems. The user want to completely wipe off the partition and wants to install bog-standard jaunty. User can do this by gparted which can wipe any type of partition. gparted can be installed by typing 'sudo apt-get install gparted' in terminal. gparted will only wipe the partition which user is intended to do. The other ways to do it are (1) dban. Download dban from 'http://www.dban.org/' It can be downloaded as iso and transfer it to a disc which further can be used to wipe all the hard drives including XP partition.(2) Gparted live cd/ubuntu live cd can also be used for this purpose. There is other ntfs partion likely a recovery partition for XP. XP has a partition manager which can be useful for creating partition. XP partition can be accessed by right clicking my computer then click manage and then on left pane click disc management. XP partition is not full featured as gparted but it shows the same drive labels and it won&#8217;t extend the drive to fill the space but will allow you to delete the partitions It is better to use XP Partition compare to gparted as it is safe and will not destroy windows. As a precaution, back up all the data and install jaunty. Jaunty installation can be done using live Cd.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is regard to wipe only ubuntu partitions keep XP partition intact and install Jaunty. This is resolved as follows:in terminal, type sudo gparted if its not installed, type sudo apt-get install gparted gparted can wipe any type of partition and with relative ease. Just have make sure to wipe the partition user intend to, and can fubar the drive if by chance get rid of the wrong thing. Elaboration is provided in http://www.dban.org/ and download the iso, burn it to a disc, reboot, and watch your hard-drive disappear. If to flatten it then choose the fastest method, all zeroes.To tell which ones are XP sda2 looks to be it. The other ntfs partition is likely a recovery partition for XP. If user want to make sure, boot into XP, use XP's partition manager to see what size and format XP partition is- and more than likely its NTFS and around the size of sda2. XP has a partition manager and can be located by  right click my computer, click manage, then on left pane click disc management. Not as full featured as gparted, but it shows the same drive labels when in the my computer screen, so one will be able to verify which is which. It wont let extend the drive to fill the space, but it will let the user to delete partitions at least. Now the user can delete the ubuntu partitions from there. Sometime later, if user want to wipe all the XP partition and install jaunty this can be resolved as following: Create a back up and  then insert a Jaunty CD and boot from it and during install, select Guided Use entire hard drive. No need to do erase it within the live CD, just once click to install it, it'll be one of the pages that comes up during the install.

    <Body> After adding songs to my MP3 player, I went to check to make sure everything sounded OK. When I played the songs on Rhythmbox, Exhaile, and Amarok, a majority of the songs skipped in various locations. I checked them in Microsoft Media Player (ugh), and none of the songs skipped. Is there a media player available in Linux that doesn't skip? Or am I just being too much of a perfectionist? Thanks for any assistance. </Body>

      <Owner> Pemur1, I would be curious to know what kind of machine you are using, and what kind of audio adapter.  I am having the same problem when playing mp3's (perhaps other audio, as well) using a Dell Mini 9 (Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)).  For me, this problem did not surface until some time in the last few weeks. Prior to that, I'd had no issues at all. </Owner>

      <Owner> Skipping takes place with mplayer, as it does with any other player.  Just to experiment, I just tried installing a few other players that do not use gstreamer to see how well they might do. I tried xfmedia and even banshee. Neither of them would play mp3's at all, to my very great surprise.  I have all the codecs, etc. installed, and as I mentioned earlier, up until a few weeks ago, I had no issues with audio on this Mini 9 at all. </Owner>

      <Owner>  Quote: I totally disagree. I know that some people have issues with it, but it works absolutely fantastic for me.  It probably depends on what audio hardware you have. But I get audio mixed from all my applications (including WINE).  The OP's problem is likely hardware related or the audio driver for their specific hardware.  My audio never skips, even when running all 4 cores to the max. </Owner>

      <Owner> If you're playing the mp3 files from a USB drive, then you should be aware that a bug in Ubuntu causes USB 2.0 devices to run at USB 1.0 speeds in some cases. There are numerous bug reports on this and apparently the bug has existed since Ibex. I had this problem with the stock kernel and the new 2.6.30 kernel and went back to the 2.6.29.5 kernel to solve it. If installing a new kernel is out of your league, then as a band-aide measure, you could use Audacious and define a large buffer. Do this as follows:  1. Launch Audacious 2. left-click the small square in the upper left-hand corner of the player window 3. Select preferences; then the audio icon on the left of the resulting window 4. Change the Buffer size to something like 1000 (play with it until the skipping stops.)  Good luck! </Owner>

      <Owner> Pulse has always worked for me, I am now happy to be back to it after some bad experience with Kubuntu's sound. I get good sound using wine + virtual box + Audacious at the same time.  If the Linus system is set up properly, sound doesn't skip, that is why I said that it must be a driver/setting issue. </Owner>

      <Owner> I wound up following Th3_uN1Qu3's advice, and removing pulseaudio.   I am not sure why I didn't decide to do this earlier, considering that I have been trying to correct this problem for several hours now, and had already had a very long and dysfunctional relationship with pulseaudio.  This appears to have solved all of my audio issues. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user had problem with adding songs to the MP3 player. When the user tried to play the songs on Rhythmbox, Exhaile and Amarok, a majority of the songs skipped in various locations but when checked with Microsoft Media Player, none of the songs skipped. User wanted to find a media player for linux that does not skip the music files. Songbird is a music player with no problem of skipping files. The problem can be due to a sound driver rather than any particular software issue. Similar problem had been observed with Exhaile software but using Banshee software had no such issues. The other user had a same problem and was curious to know the machine configuration of the user who had posted the question on the thread. Similar problem has been experienced with the software xfmedia, mplayer and banshee. Mp3 files operated from USB drive can create this problem which can be due to a bug in Ubuntu which causes USB 2.0 devices to run at USB 1.0 speeds in some cases. Similar problem had been observed with the stock kernel. The other solution to this problem can be the use of Audacious and defining a large buffer. This can be done my launching audacious then left clicking the small square in the upper let-hand corner of the player window and select preferences and then select the audio icon on the left of the resulting window and change the buffer size. Play the music files until it stops skipping. The problem was solved by the removal of pulseaudio. It was not a driver issue.</Summary_1>

      <Owner> Just thought I'd pop in to mention a few things: 1. For Gutsy, there are patches to Nautilus 2.20 to make it render icons over a clear background, but not for Nautilus 2.22. Blame the GNOME devs for making massive changes to libeel. 2. We (Compiz) no longer support the Cube background drawing, and it has been removed in the git version. 3. We've thrown our support over a newly rewritten Wallpaper plugin, which works even if you don't use the cube. </Owner>

    <Title>ATI Radeon x700: no desktop effects</Title>
    <Owner>Methuselah</Owner>
    <Body> I don't want to use xgl so that's not a solution for me. Also the proprietary ati driver does very bad things to my machine so it's not an option either. I've had compiz working (with an ati 9600 using the ati driver) under both freebsd and gutsy. I guessing it should work with the x700 under hardy because the card is listed as being quite well supported on the Xorg website.   However, running compiz gives:   Quote: My xorg.conf is below. Not sure what the extra sections below the ServerLayout are for. I only have one screen and video card.   Quote: My first unix-like system was freebsd and I have to say, I find ubuntu harder to deal with when things don't work as they should. The display is supposed to be autoconfigured for you so you're not quite sure what to do when it breaks down. I didn't even have widescreen resolutions after I installed and the tool from gutsy that allows you to choose your monitor type was nowhere to be found in the menus. Eventually, I got widescreen working by running that tool. Right now, I'm not even sure if I'm free to edit my xorg.conf or whether it will confuse an tool that already edits it. Any guidance will be appreciated! </Body>

    <Title>Screen blinks black and I am returned to the login screen</Title>
    <Owner>Ingo88</Owner>
    <Body> I am experiencing a rather weird and very annoying problem in Ubuntu (Hardy). I did experience this in Gutsy too, but not as often as in Hardy.  Sometimes, at completely random occasions (while burning a cd with K3b, while reading my webmail in firefox etc.) the screen goes black for a second, returns to normal for a second, and then suddenly I am brought back to the login screen. This sure could be enraging especially if I'd have some unsaved documents or e-mail messages open when it happens. Luckily I haven't been that unfortunate yet.  When I upgraded to Hardy I first tried to install Kubuntu as I mostly use KDE apps (K3b, digiKam, Gwenview), but there I was kicked back to the login screen about all the time. Besides, it was way slower than Ubuntu.  Any clues what the problem might be? I intend to use Hardy throughout the LTS period, but I sure can't live with problems like this.

I just was surprised by seeing the login screen when I walked past the screen.  syslog:  Code: thought I'd also post the contents of Xorg.0.log:  Code: The system has also been weirdly slow lately. It's not even long ago I installed Hardy. Maybe sometime in August... It was 8.04.1 anyhow. I don't see why it's so slow either. Neither the CPU usage nor the memory usage seem high when the system feels awfully slow. Especially at startup (the gnome panel takes forever to load, and sometimes some applets fail to load).   Could it be some bug with Xorg that's causing my troubles? Should I go to bugs.launchpad.net and look for help? </Owner>

    <Title>change the close button location</Title>
    <Owner>hydraulicjj</Owner>
    <Body> Hi. does anyone know how i can change the location of the close button in ubuntu hardy so that it is like on osx? </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> I do not know where it is located on OSX, but ...  The quit button is actually a  quot;launcher quot; called Quit and can be put anywhere a launcher can go.  For example to add one to the bottom panel, right-click the panel and choose  quot;Add to Panel quot; and select  quot;Quit quot; from the list.  Likewise if you are using AWN, add the Quit launcher to the AWN panel. </Owner>

      <Owner> I think he's talking about the window-decorator close button...  You can do this with the emerald theme manager, assuming you use emerald as your window decorator...    Which function to specify with which letter you can make up with the help below. Starting left, the first : makes is centered, the next : right aligned.  Just take the window as an example,  Code:  is mine at the beginning, and you can see, left aligned I got the icon as well as the window title, nothing centered here, and then the other 4 functions, ANXC for set above, minimize, etc...  you may use spacers as well simply by adding the count of pixels the space should have in brackets.  I(10)T::ANXC would leave 10 pixels of space between the icon and the title.  Hope this is actually answering your question ^^ </Owner>

      <Owner> There is a way to change it without using Emerald.  Hit alt and F2 which will bring up the run application dialogue. From there you type in  Code: and hit enter. from there all you need to do is hit ctrl and f and search for metacity, click the link that says /apps/metacity/general and then scroll down to button_layout. just click on the right side where it says menu:etc and then to get it like a mac you would have it be close,minimize,maximize:menu </Owner>

    <Title>Can Permissions Bollix Java Runtime Environment?</Title>
    <Owner>psuliin</Owner>
    <Body> I recently had a system glitch that disabled my $HOME/.dmrc directory. I managed to get my home directory back under my ownership with 644 privileges, and went on about my business. Then a couple of days later (today) I noticed that a website that required Java wasn't running right.   I checked Firefox's preferences and  quot;Enable Java quot; is checked. My Java Runtime Environment is installed - and it was working a week or so ago when I visited this same website. However I went back to my firefox and java directories (the former is in my /usr/lib directory and the latter in my home directory) and noticed that the ownership of the directories is different: $HOME/java is owned by me (as it should be since I changed the ownership of my home directory back to myself recently), but /usr/lib/firefox-3.0.4 is owned by root.  The normal process of enabling Java involved placing a link to my JRE (in $HOME/java) in my firefox folder. Did changing ownership of that $HOME/java folder while leaving my firefox folder with root break that link? </Body>
    <Summary_1>The user had an ownership issue with the Java. Even though, the user had permission to enable java files for firefox but it was noticed that the ownership of the java directories were different. The user wanted to know whether the changing ownership of the home folder while leaving the firefox folder with root break that link.</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is in regard to changing ownership of that $HOME/java folder while leaving firefox folder with root lead to break that link.

    <Title>Firefox 3.0.1 starts gconfd under KDE</Title>
    <Owner>mtrainer</Owner>
    <Body> Hi,  I am running KDE 3.5.10 on Kubuntu 8.04 64-bit. Whenever I start Firefox 3.0.1 it automatically starts gconfd if it is installed. The only way to stop that is to remove the package containing gconfd (libgconf2-4). This also requires that I remove dia and inkscape. The funny thing is that running dia and inkscape don't start gconfd. Is there any way I can stop firefox from using gconfd if it is installed so I can leave dia and inkscape installed?  Thanks  Murray </Body>

    <Title>passwd Problem - can't log on</Title>
    <Owner>Chebyshev</Owner>
    <Body> I just upgraded to 8.10 2 days ago and it was working fine. Just now, I tried to get samba working properly again and something got screwy with my user account. Trying to change my password using passwd produces a segfault. If I boot into recovery mode, the same thing happens. I can make a new account and change its password just fine.  When I try to log on in gdm, it seems to crash and restart itself. If I try to log on from the console, it just doesn't log me on and re-presents the logon prompt with no information. The same thing happens if I try to log on as root (I made a root password in recovery mode). If I boot to recovery mode and su to my username, it works fine.  I tried deleting my user account and re-adding it, but passwd still fails for that account name.  Any ideas? </Body>
    <Comment>
      <Owner> After more fooling around, I've found the following:  A regular boot doesn't allow any user to log on, including root. The logon fails with no message and if using gdm, it crashes and restarts itself.  A recovery mode boot allows me to log on a root and su to whatever user I want. If I try to do anything using passwd on my original username, passwd segfaults, but it works on any other username, including root.  I'm completely mystified. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user had a problem with the user account. User tried to change the password using passwd which produced a segfault. Whenever the user tried to log in gdm,it crashed and restarted itself. The user was unable to log on from the console and it represented the logon prompt with no information. If the computer boot to recovery mode an su to a username password worked well. User tried deleting user account and re-adding it but passwd still failed for that account name. The user tried to login from gdm login screen but it did not worked out. The other user had faced a similar problem. The user was logged in and installed nvidia driver through envy-ng and restarted the system. It was working all the day but on the next morning the user was not able to login in. The problem was due to libpam_smbpass. The solution was after try to login and dmesg and Code:</Summary_1>
    <Summary_2>This discussion is regard to password problem and unable to login to the system after installing an upgrade or a software. This can be resolved in one way as  the package that seems to cause the problem is libpam_smbpass, after try to login and see dmesg and did: Code.</Summary_2>

    <Title>USB problems that I can't seem to fix!</Title>
    <Owner>ashleydangerous</Owner>
    <Body> Basically, I'm using Ubuntu 8.10 and have a USB headset that will randomly stop working and refuse to work again until I reboot, even after I plug it back in (the red power light won't even go on.) I also have a USB webcam that won't work at all, even though it used to work just fine.  I've tried:Adding uhci_hcd to the modprobe blacklist Reinstalling any packages I could find relating to USB Running Skype and webcam apps with the LD_PRELOAD commands recommended in the stickied ibex post  None of these seem to help at all  I'd really appreciate the help, as I spend a lot of time teleconferencing with coworkers and these USB problems are really becoming problematic.  Please let me know if you have any ideas, and I will try to implement them.  Thanks a ton!  </Body>

      <Owner> Maybe if you can post some related dmesg information and lsusb we could be more help. Are you using ports on the front or back because even though I have new computer my front ports will not work with some things properly like webcam and external drive. Not sure why. </Owner>

      <Owner> Hello! I tried plugging the webcam into the back port of the computer, and the same thing happens -- Skype shows a garbled green screen. I installed cheese, and the video seems to work there.  I searched the forums, and tried:  LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skype  but the garbled greenness is still there in Skype.  Anyways, here is the information from the commands you mentioned! The headset hasn't decided to stop working on its own yet, but when it does I will check dmesg and report back.

    <Title>Lightspeed NXT on Wubi Ubuntu</Title>
    <Owner>I am generic</Owner>
    <Body> So I've convinced my mom to install wubi ubuntu for her work computer due to its lower maintenance requirements compared to windows. This is just a temporary thing to see if she prefers linux over windows however since this is a work computer it requires certain software that is required for her business to run properly, Lightspeed NXT. Now I have been looking for a tutorial but can't find one and frankly there is a kink in getting this paticular bit of software to run correctly. It requires the Lightspeed NXT people to be able to connect to the windows remote desktop client which obviously throws a monkey wrench into the whole linux idea. Now I'm hoping that anybody that has experience running the lightspeed nxt client will hit me up with some info on how to get this paticular program to run on wubi ubuntu. Make sure to assume that I am stupid and use small syllable words and walk me through every little bit because I'm a bit slow when it comes to linux and don't actually run this on my home computer. I'm mostly installing linux on this machine for the low upkeep and unlikeliness of viruses. </Body>
    <Summary_1>Lightspeed NXT on Wubi Ubuntu The user is switching the system's Os from windows to linux to reduce the maintenance requirements.

    <Title>new server installation hp proliant dl145</Title>
    <Owner>emergencydpt</Owner>
    <Body> Hi. I got a proliant dl145 server from a garage sale. It's not working of course. I don't know what  quot;g quot; number it is, if any. I don't think it's a g2 or 3 but may be a plain dl145 or possibly a g1. Does anyone know how to tell the difference between these hp proliant servers from looking at them?  It will not consistantly boot up. I can boot it up to the bios and get it to pass post if I reset cmos. However it won't do it a second time unless I again reset it.  I downloaded the ubutu server edition and made a cd but it won't boot up. Perhaps I did it wrong. I dl the files to my desktop then I extracted everything to a disk. Is that correct? I don't think so because when I look at the disk I see further zipped files on deeper file levels.  Soooo. 1. How to find out if ubutu will run on my server...what server do I have? 2. Step by step instructions for creating a disk the server will boot to and install the OS. 3. Why is it not booting consistantly? I note there is a missing box on the back right side where something plugs in...could it be the server management processor and that's why it doesn't boot?  Thanks for your help.  PS I want to make a home server to store all my movies on. What else do I need? A graphics card with hdmi to plug into my TV? A sound card? Or should it serve out to another computer that handles this at the tv? Obviously I don't want to spend money on this if something is wrong.  -EmergencyDpt </Body>

    <Summary_2>The discussion is in regard to the compiz not working in the system. The user has  installed compiz and emarald when user type "compiz" into the terminal it is generating an error meesage and also with "compiz--replace" command. This is yet to be resolved.</Summary_2>

    <Body> Hello, I have read lot's of things about how you can use SSH to tell your home computer to download a file while you're at work or whatever but is their anyway to start downloading a file, log out of SSH and get back to whatever and still have the remote computer download the file using wget?  Thanks in advance! </Body>

      <Owner> Use FreeNX, it will maintain a session on the server even when you are not logged in.  http://freenx.berlios.de/download.php </Owner>

      <Owner> Another way you can do it is to write a shell script like:   Code: The first line is part of shell scripting -- it tells the program where the shell is  The second line,  quot;sleep 10 quot;, tells the terminal to  quot;sleep quot; for 10 seconds, thus delaying wget.  You can run that with the command  quot;sh shellscripthere  amp; quot; The  quot; amp; quot; tells it to run it in the background. You then can log out and in 10 seconds the file will start downloading.  Have a nice day! </Owner>

      <Owner> There's also apt://screen. Start a screen by running  Code:  Then run whatever (non-gui) program you like inside screen, and detach the screen by hitting ctrl+a+d or simply closing the terminal window. The program(s) you run in screen will keep running in the background after you detach. To get back to the program(s), log back in to the server and run the following to reattach  Code: . You can run several screens at a time, and you can have several windows inside the screen, so you can run several programs inside the screen at the same time. </Owner>

    <Summary_1>The user needed information about downloading the file with the remote computer using wget without logging out of SSH. FreeNX was the software which can be used as it will maintain a session on the server even when the user was not logged in. The information could be found on a following webpage. http://freenx.berlios.de/download.php The other was to write a shell script like: Code: The first line is part of shell scripting -- it tells the program where the shell is The second line, "sleep 10", tells the terminal to "sleep" for 10 seconds, thus delaying wget.A user can run that with the command "sh shellscripthere &amp;" The "&amp;" tells it to run it in the background. A user then can log out and in 10 seconds the file will start downloading. The another was apt://screen. Start a screen by running Code: Then run whatever (non-gui) program which a user like inside screen, and detach the screen by hitting ctrl+a+d or simply closing the terminal window. The program(s) a user run in screen will keep running in the background after you detach. To get back to the program(s), log back in to the server and run the following to reattach Code: . A user can run several screens at a time, and you can have several windows inside the screen, so you can run several programs inside the screen at the same time.

    <Summary_2>This discussion in regard to how one can use SSH to tell home computer to download a file while someone is at work using wget. In other words, is their anyway to start downloading a file, log out of SSH and get back to it and still have the remote computer download the file using wget. The solutions provided are as follows: 1) Use FreeNX, it will maintain a session on the server even when the user is not logged in. http://freenx.berlios.de/download.php. 2) Another way the user can do it is to write a shell script like: Code: The first line is part of shell scripting -- it tells the program where the shell is The second line, "sleep 10", tells the terminal to "sleep" for 10 seconds, thus delaying wget. The user can run that with the command "sh shellscripthere &amp;" The "&amp;" tells it to run it in the background. Then user can log out and in 10 seconds the file will start downloading. 3) There's also apt://screen. Start a screen by running Code: Then run any non-gui program user like inside screen, and detach the screen by hitting ctrl+a+d or simply closing the terminal window. The program(s) the user run in screen will keep running in the background after user detach. To get back to the program(s), user can log back in to the server and run the following to reattach Code: . User can run several screens at a time, and have several windows inside the screen, so that user can run several programs inside the screen at the same time. 4) Basically, SSH is a way of connecting securely to a computer. User can setup an ssh server on computer for e.g. openssh is very popular (configuration link: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-...configuration/ Wget is a command line utility to download things from the web. For further reference: http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl1_wget.htm; once, the user install ssh then its like working on local computer via terminal (using terminal one can familiar with common unix commands from the sources like http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)</Summary_2>
